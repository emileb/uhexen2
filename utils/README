This package is put together essentially by merging two files
released by Raven, namely H2_UTILS.EXE (for original Hexen2)
and h2mputil.zip (for the mission pack).  Only a couple of
trivial changes were needed to make them compile under Linux.

Another utility included here is jsh2color: it is a lit file
generator taken from the old jshexen sources.

Also included here is dcc, a progs.dat compiler/decompiler
for Hexen2 by Eric Hobbs. It is only interesting due to its
decompiler facility.
