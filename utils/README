This package is put together essentially by merging two files
released by Raven, namely H2_UTILS.EXE (for original Hexen2)
and h2mputil.zip (for the mission pack).

Only a couple of trivial changes were needed to make them
compile under Linux (see the file Ref/utils_linux.diff,
included here for your reference). The original License by
Activision file while they released H2_UTILS.EXE is included
here, as well (see Ref/LICENSE.txt).

Also included here is dcc, a progs.dat compiler/decompiler
for Hexen2 by Eric Hobbs. It is only interesting due to its
decompiler facility.
