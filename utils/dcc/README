progs.dat compiler/decompiler for Hexen2 by Eric Hobbs.
Read the author's dcc.txt file for usage/details.

Made only small touches to the original code so that it
compiles under Linux (x86). Only interesting due to its
decompiler facility. Since the original author cannot be
contacted (at least not from the address written in the
package), there possibly won't be any improvements. Most
probably no one would need this utility today, anyway, 
but I put it here for reference.
