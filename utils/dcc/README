progs.dat compiler/decompiler for Hexen2 by Eric Hobbs.
Read the author's dcc.txt file for usage/details.

Probably only interesting due to its decompiler facility.
Oh, and there may be a few mods out there which can only
be compiled by dhcc, such as the HexenC code of Project
Peanut.  I put this here mostly for reference.
