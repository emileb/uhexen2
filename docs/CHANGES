Changes since AoT 1.2.0:
------------------------

  "No Boss" bug in Dan's original linux port fixed (Hexen2 now loads more than
  noe progsN.dat files). As a bonus, a no range checking bug is fixed alongside
  this one.
  Proper fullscreen mode(s) for OpenGL.
  Screen sizes are selectable with "-width" and "-height" options.
  Interactive video modes in software game disabled.
  - Video Modes menu now displays help message.
  The "-mode" cmdline arg is now removed.
  Height values corresponding to --width are properly added.
  Mouse grab in window modes , which is released with menus, pause and console
  GL glow patch by JS.
  New menu items for GL Glow, Chase mode, Draw Shadows.
  Two general overflow bug-fixes.
  Heapsize is now 32768 default
  Intermission screens are now drawn fullscreen. This includes the help menu
  screen where the fonts were mostly unreadable before. The final splash screens
  now centre the messages properly, too.
  Wheelmouse support is added.
  An experimental SDL sound driver is added. It's very buggy a.t.m., though.
  The annoying ".dynamic" extensions are removed from the binary names.
  Building for pentium as default now.
