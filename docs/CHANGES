Changes since AoT 1.2.0:
------------------------

-   No Boss bug in Dan's original linux port fixed: Hexen2 loads progs2.dat
    along with progs.dat, as it should, now.

-   A range checking bug is fixed along with the No Boss bug.

-   Proper fullscreen mode(s) for OpenGL.

-   Screen sizes are selectable with "-width" and "-height" options, now.
    The "-mode" cmdline arg is removed.

-   Launcher is fully functional and works fine with fullscreen opengl modes.

-   Interactive video modes in software game disabled.

-   Video Modes menu now displays help message.

-   Height values corresponding to --width are properly added.

-   Mouse grab in window modes, released with menus, pause and console.
    Mouse can be bound in the Options menu in window mode.  "-nomouse"
    option works in window mode.

-   GL glow patch from jshexen2.

-   New menu items for GL Glow, Chase mode, Draw Shadows.

-   Two general overflow bug-fixes by Pa3Pyx.

-   Heapsize is now 32768 default

-   An experimental SDL sound driver is added. Very buggy for now.

-   The final splash screens now centre the messages properly.

-   Intermission screens now drawn fullscreen (from Pa3Pyx). This includes the
    help menu screen where the fonts seemed unreadably small.

-   Wheelmouse support is added.

-   The annoying ".dynamic" extensions are removed from the binary names.

-   Fixed textures going AWOL in GL mode upon loading savegames many times.
    This used to result in white info-plaques, for instance.

-   Fixed fire attacks of Demoness and Praevus which used to draw lines across
    the screen.

-   Fixed the gl_other_glows option not being written into config.cfg

-   The "GL GLOWS" menu entry is fixed. It now controls gl_other_glows, too.

-   Made the music automatically restart when changed in the options menu.

-   Removed console spamming code (gl_extensions, unbinding files, etc.)

-   Previous Weapon  entry added to the Customize Controls menu.

-   Use glGetIntegerv to detect maximum supported texture size, not vendor
    string.

-   Using redhat rpm style arch flags ( -march=i386 -mcpu=i686 ).

-   Add/enable the cmdline options -witholdmission and -noold for H2MP.

-   BIG code cleanup including retiring some unused files, retiring old opengl
    files, killing many compiler warnings, etc.

-   The Launcher works fine with GTK2 now.

-   Prepared an installer (using loki_setup tools from CVS / 2004-12-26)

-   Fixed gameplay issue: Eidolon fails landing (automatic install using
    the installer)

-   Fixed gameplay issue: Holy item in the Cathedral balcony not reachable
    (automatic install using the installer)

-   Fixed (mostly) gameplay issue: Eidolon loses hostility under certain
    conditions  (automatic install using the installer)

-   Probably some other minor things that we forgot.
