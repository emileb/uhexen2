ChangeLog:

2005-02-14 (CVS, 1.2.4-rc1):
    * added ability to disable ALSA support at compile time
    * fix mouse not being activated after connecting to a server in
      windowed mode for hexenworld. from Steve.
    * oss sound improvements (from the quakeforge project):
      - retry 3 times opening /dev/dsp
      - open O_NONBLOCK
      - check pagesize when mmaping
      - reset /dev/dsp when closing it (from the twilight project)
    * alsa sound improvements:
      - more error checking and detailed error reporting
      - replicate the order in quakeforge as much as possible

2005-02-12 (CVS):
    * more general clean-up:
      - delete dead win32 code from linux files
      - Kill sound/music messing in vid code: S_Init() and CDAudio_Init()
        are called AFTER VID_Init(), so this should be correct.
        See hexen2/host.c for reasoning on Win32.
      - we can never reach CheckTextureExtensions(), we'll give up
        in GL_Init_Functions() if we don't like the gl_library...
      - also comment out CheckArrayExtensions(), its call is if0'ed out
    * added 48000 to the alsa rate switch
    * added paranoid sound driver checks
    * added missing scrolltitle in the software version of VID_MenuDraw()

2005-02-10 (CVS):
    * removed unused functions SV_SaveEffects, SV_LoadEffects,
      SV_RemoveGIPFiles and SV_CopyFiles from hwsv.
    * fixed a typo in hwcl software draw code
    * fixed a format warning in hwsv

2005-02-09 (CVS):
    * killed a bunch of compiler warnings
    * killed all unused HW menu stuff

2005-02-08 (CVS):
    * video modes clean-up:
      - removed cvar _vid_default_mode_win
      - removed all mode descriptions
      - removed all nummodes and VID_NumModes stuff
      - removed all VID_GetXXX and VID_DescXXX stuff
      - beautified the Video Modes menu screen a little
      - removed firstupdate things (VID_Update() in vid_sdl.c)
    * tiny whitespace cleanup in in_sdl.c
    * draw alpha console background in Hexen2 (Draw_AlphaPic() from HW)
    * if0-out fxPalTexImage2D (we don't use it)
    * display the "meshing XXX" spam for developers only

2005-02-06 (CVS):
    * first sketchy update to the README files regarding
      the recent sound changes
    * move cd_win.c and resource.h to ./win_stuff/
    * tiny makefiles cleanup
    * tiny log entries cleanup in snd_sdl.c, midi_sdl.c

2005-02-05 (CVS):
    * fixed silly copy+paste error in snd_alsa.c
    * fixed demo builds of the launcher
    * fastsqrt.cpp isn't used for ages, moved it to ./obsolete/
    * separated win32 and linux versions of midi files, too much
      mess otherwise
    * midi file paths cleanup: they should have been leftovers
      from times when gamedir and userdir were the same
    * killed Com_WriteFileFullPath(), not used anymore
    * replaced some Con_Printf() with Sys_Printf() in midi_sdl.c
    * added midi volume control (partially from Pa3PyX)
    * updated the midi stuff (volume ctrl, etc) for win32, too
    * fixed possible path length overflows in midi_sdl.c
    * killed Com_LoadHunkFile2() in hexen2 [from HexenWorld]
    * don't try extracting anything if no midi file is given
    * ported all midi changes from hexen2 to hexenworld
    * applied the HexenWorld specific changes to midi_sdl.c and
      enabled midi in the HW makefiles. who knows why it didn't
      work in aot before...

2005-02-04 (CVS):
    * made sdl_audio actually work (finally)
    * some snd_dma.c fixes from the tenebrae project
    * killed fakedma (simsound). one less thing to worry about
    * fixed cd music stops playing on volume change (reported
      by Julien Langer)
    * added actual cdrom volume control via CDROMVOLCTRL.
      cdrom isn't paused when the user volume is 0, anymore
      (should have been a trick to silence the cdrom before
      this control was present). BSD ioctls may be different,
      add conditionals for it one day...
    * added ALSA sound driver (from the quakeforge project)
    * we now build all all the sound drivers in and choose from
      the command line. oss is default

    * merged small bits from the hw version of midi.c into h2
    * small whitespace cleanups in snd_oss.c, snd_mem.c, snd_dma.c,
      cd_linux.c. Heavy whitespace changes in midi.c, midi.h.

    * removed forking from the launcher which now serves nothing
    * added sound driver selection to the launcher

    * sbar fixes from Pa3pyX' sources
    * added missing things to the makefiles
    * launcher:
      - fixed fork/execv again (thanks Steve)
      - fixed args to execv (thanks again Steve)
      - added an option to not close the gui after launching
    * game hcode:
      - added Raven's Siege hcode
      - added+fixed map cycling code to hexenworld and siege
      - added Kor S karn's further fixes to the siege code

2005-01-24 (CVS):
    * consolidate GL_LoadTexture functions
    * fix flush_textures decision which used to be always true
    * add sky alpha
    * gl filter changes

2005-01-23 (CVS):
    * Hexen2/HW: support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (patch from
      Julien Langer) Let's see if this behaves for everybody.
    * Launcher:  search for known hexenworld game-types and
      provide a list menu. v0.4.8.

1.2.3: Changes since HoT-1.2.2:
2005-01-20
    * Release 1.2.3-final

2005-01-18/19 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc8):
    * Hexen2/HexenWorld:
    - Fixed userdirs to work correctly against the -game arg.
    - Added "qboolean adduser" arg to COM_AddGameDir() (useful esp.
      in HW):  com_userdir evolves gradually. Every search path
      added has a consequence of additon of (multiple) unnecessary
      userpaths. Avoid it where we can. (original aot also added the
      very same userdir multiple times)
    - Changed all instances of "id1" to "data1"
    * Game Launcher (major changes):
    - Fixed (hopefully) fork() / execv()
    - Removed clumsy renderer selection, toggling ogl is enough.
    - Removed res-buttons, made a slider, more compact interface.
    - Made lower/upper bounds of the res-scale renderer-dependant.
    - Disallowed launching when proper binary is absent. Added a
      statusbar which notifies the user for this.
    - Removed already commented-out demoness-in-old-mission.
    - Put the widgets to be played with remotely are put in to
      structs properly for easier handling. The binary output is
      even smaller now.
    - For Gtk2.0 builds, replaced gtk_widget_set_usize() with
      gtk_widget_set_size_request()
    - Much code clean-up (apparently)
    - Removed gtk_widget_set_uposition(). We seem to do fine with
      gtk_fixed_put().
    - Hacked the version number into the window title.  [v0.4.6]
    - Combined a bunch of on_ThisEvent() type callback functions
      which had been doing the same  x = !x  thing
    - Fixed / cleaned-up config_file.c.
    - Version 0.4.7.

2005-01-13 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc7):

    * Fix off-by-one error in demo ending message line calculation.
    * Fixed mouse behavior which was always broken in hexen2-linux.
      Middle-button is MOUSE2, right-button is MOUSE3, not vice versa
      (see SDL_mouse.h). The wheelmouse patch fixed this a little, but
      introduced a mouse2/mouse3 fight in in_sdl.c. It is fixed here.
    * Fixed the debug message about undefined mouse buttons.
    * Did some syncing between H2 and HW versions of input files.
    * Misc cleanups (nitpicking/polishing).

2005-01-08 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc6):

    * don't die on cache mismatch, delete and and reload the new
      texture.
    * slight gl clean-ups.

2005-01-07 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc5):

    * _windowed_mouse default is 1 in gl mode, too.
    * bind Alt+Enter combination to Steven's stuff for fullscreen-
      windowed toggling

2005-01-03 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc4):

    * gl_ztrick disabled by default for hexenworld, too
    * Also compiled against glibc-2.2 with gcc-2.96 (on rh-7.3) and
      included properly in the installer.
    * Fixed a compilation error in case of gcc-2.96

2005-01-02 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc3):

    * Retired AoT, aot and .aot: Change userdir (AOT_USERDIR) to .hexen2
      (for the demo, it's .hexen2demo)
    * Added clarifications about network-compatibility in the docs.
    * Code clean-up in Hexen2 and Launcher. Big clean-up in Hexenworld.

2004-12-29 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc2):

    * Launcher: Some usability tweaks. Removed the mouse option, added
      the disable networking option.
    * Hexen2: Fullscreen/Windowed mode is now switchable. Seems to work
      good. (from Steven).
    * Hexen2: Mouse can now be disabled for fullscreen modes (from Steven).
    * HexenWorld Client: Merge some Hexen2 changes:
      o Fix the fire attacks drawing lines across the screen
      o Don't print gl_extensions which spams the console
      o Partially merge Steven's mouse tweaks from 2004-12-29.

2004-12-28 (CVS):

    * Fixed gameplay issue: Holy item in the Cathedral balcony not
      reachable (automatic install using the installer).
    * Fixed (mostly) gameplay issue: Eidolon loses hostility under
      certain conditions (automatic install using the installer).
    * Fixed gameplay issue: Eidolon fails landing (automatic install
      using the installer).
    * Prepared an installer (using loki_setup tools from CVS / 
      2004-12-26).
    * The Launcher works fine with GTK2 now.
    * Using redhat rpm style arch flags ( -march=i386 -mcpu=i686 ).
    * Fixed textures going AWOL in GL mode upon loading savegames many
      times. This used to result in white info-plaques, for instance
      (adapted from pa3pyx).
    * The "GL GLOWS" menu entry is fixed. It now controls
      gl_other_glows, too.
    * Fixed the gl_other_glows option not being written into config.cfg
    * Previous Weapon entry added to the Customize Controls menu.
    * Removed second arg from the function EmitSkyPolys.
    * Use glGetIntegerv to detect maximum supported texture size, not
      vendor string.
    * gl_max_size is not a cvar anymore. Also killed cvar gl_nobind.
    * Merge newer snd_dma code from HexenWorld to Hexen2.
    * Intermission screens now drawn fullscreen (from pa3pyx).
      This includes the help menu screen where the fonts seemed
      unreadably small.
    * Wheelmouse support is added.
    * Removed console spamming code (gl_extensions, unbinding files, etc.)


1.2.2: Changes since HoT 1.2.1:

    * Launcher is fully functional and works fine with fullscreen opengl
      modes.
    * Fixed fire attacks of Demoness and Praevus drawing lines across
      the screen.
    * The annoying ".dynamic" extensions are removed from the binary names.
    * HexenWorld: dlsym'ed all calls to GL functions with
      SDL_GL_GetProcAddress.
    * Made the music automatically restart when changed in the options
      menu.
    * Heapsize is now 32768 default
    * The final splash screens now centre the messages properly.
    * Added an experimental SDL sound driver. Very buggy for now.
      (We acept patches ;)
    * Mouse grab in window modes, released with menus, pause and console.
      Mouse can be bound in the Options menu in window mode. "-nomouse"
      option works in window mode.


1.2.1: Changes since AoT 1.2.0:

    * New menu items for GL Glow, Chase mode, Draw Shadows.
    * GL glow patch from jshexen2.
    * Interactive video modes in software game disabled.
    * Video Modes menu now displays help message.
    * Height values corresponding to --width are properly added.

      now. The "-mode" cmdline arg is removed.
    * Proper fullscreen mode(s) for OpenGL.
    * Two general overflow bug-fixes from pa3pyx.
    * BIG code cleanup including retiring some unused files, retiring
      old opengl files, killing many compiler warnings, etc.
    * A range checking bug is fixed along with the No Boss bug.
