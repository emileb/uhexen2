ChangeLog:

2005-02-01 (CVS):
    * fixed the demos without models with -nosound
    * initial style-only sound code syncing between h2 and hw
    * sbar fixes from Pa3pyX' sources
    * added missing things to the makefiles
    * game hcode:
      - added Raven's Siege hcode
      - added+fixed map cycling code to hexenworld and siege
      - added Kor S karn's further fixes to the siege code

2005-01-24 (CVS):
    * consolidate GL_LoadTexture functions
    * fix flush_textures decision which used to be always true
    * add sky alpha
    * gl filter changes

2005-01-23 (CVS):
    * Hexen2/HW: support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (patch from
      Julien Langer) Let's see if this behaves for everybody.
    * Launcher:  search for known hexenworld game-types and
      provide a list menu. v0.4.8.

1.2.3: Changes since HoT-1.2.2:
2005-01-20
    * Release 1.2.3-final

2005-01-18/19 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc8):
    * Hexen2/HexenWorld:
    - Fixed userdirs to work correctly against the -game arg.
    - Added "qboolean adduser" arg to COM_AddGameDir() (useful esp.
      in HW):  com_userdir evolves gradually. Every search path
      added has a consequence of additon of (multiple) unnecessary
      userpaths. Avoid it where we can. (original aot also added the
      very same userdir multiple times)
    - Changed all instances of "id1" to "data1"
    * Game Launcher (major changes):
    - Fixed (hopefully) fork() / execv()
    - Removed clumsy renderer selection, toggling ogl is enough.
    - Removed res-buttons, made a slider, more compact interface.
    - Made lower/upper bounds of the res-scale renderer-dependant.
    - Disallowed launching when proper binary is absent. Added a
      statusbar which notifies the user for this.
    - Removed already commented-out demoness-in-old-mission.
    - Put the widgets to be played with remotely are put in to
      structs properly for easier handling. The binary output is
      even smaller now.
    - For Gtk2.0 builds, replaced gtk_widget_set_uposition() with
      gtk_widget_set_size_request()
    - Much code clean-up (apparently)
    - Removed gtk_widget_set_uposition(). We seem to do fine with
      gtk_fixed_put().
    - Hacked the version number into the window title.  [v0.4.6]
    - Combined a bunch of on_ThisEvent() type callback functions
      which had been doing the same  x = !x  thing
    - Fixed / cleaned-up config_file.c.
    - Version 0.4.7.

2005-01-13 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc7):

    * Fix off-by-one error in demo ending message line calculation.
    * Fixed mouse behavior which was always broken in hexen2-linux.
      Middle-button is MOUSE2, right-button is MOUSE3, not vice versa
      (see SDL_mouse.h). The wheelmouse patch fixed this a little, but
      introduced a mouse2/mouse3 fight in in_sdl.c. It is fixed here.
    * Fixed the debug message about undefined mouse buttons.
    * Did some syncing between H2 and HW versions of input files.
    * Misc cleanups (nitpicking/polishing).

2005-01-08 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc6):

    * don't die on cache mismatch, delete and and reload the new
      texture.
    * slight gl clean-ups.

2005-01-07 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc5):

    * _windowed_mouse default is 1 in gl mode, too.
    * bind Alt+Enter combination to Steven's stuff for fullscreen-
      windowed toggling

2005-01-03 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc4):

    * gl_ztrick disabled by default for hexenworld, too
    * Also compiled against glibc-2.2 with gcc-2.96 (on rh-7.3) and
      included properly in the installer.
    * Fixed a compilation error in case of gcc-2.96

2005-01-02 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc3):

    * Retired AoT, aot and .aot: Change userdir (AOT_USERDIR) to .hexen2
      (for the demo, it's .hexen2demo)
    * Added clarifications about network-compatibility in the docs.
    * Code clean-up in Hexen2 and Launcher. Big clean-up in Hexenworld.

2004-12-29 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc2):

    * Launcher: Some usability tweaks. Removed the mouse option, added
      the disable networking option.
    * Hexen2: Fullscreen/Windowed mode is now switchable. Seems to work
      good. (from Steven).
    * Hexen2: Mouse can now be disabled for fullscreen modes (from Steven).
    * HexenWorld Client: Merge some Hexen2 changes:
      o Fix the fire attacks drawing lines across the screen
      o Don't print gl_extensions which spams the console
      o Partially merge Steven's mouse tweaks from 2004-12-29.

2004-12-28 (CVS):

    * Fixed gameplay issue: Holy item in the Cathedral balcony not
      reachable (automatic install using the installer).
    * Fixed (mostly) gameplay issue: Eidolon loses hostility under
      certain conditions (automatic install using the installer).
    * Fixed gameplay issue: Eidolon fails landing (automatic install
      using the installer).
    * Prepared an installer (using loki_setup tools from CVS / 
      2004-12-26).
    * The Launcher works fine with GTK2 now.
    * Using redhat rpm style arch flags ( -march=i386 -mcpu=i686 ).
    * Fixed textures going AWOL in GL mode upon loading savegames many
      times. This used to result in white info-plaques, for instance
      (adapted from pa3pyx).
    * The "GL GLOWS" menu entry is fixed. It now controls
      gl_other_glows, too.
    * Fixed the gl_other_glows option not being written into config.cfg
    * Previous Weapon entry added to the Customize Controls menu.
    * Removed second arg from the function EmitSkyPolys.
    * Use glGetIntegerv to detect maximum supported texture size, not
      vendor string.
    * gl_max_size is not a cvar anymore. Also killed cvar gl_nobind.
    * Merge newer snd_dma code from HexenWorld to Hexen2.
    * Intermission screens now drawn fullscreen (from pa3pyx).
      This includes the help menu screen where the fonts seemed
      unreadably small.
    * Wheelmouse support is added.
    * Removed console spamming code (gl_extensions, unbinding files, etc.)


1.2.2: Changes since HoT 1.2.1:

    * Launcher is fully functional and works fine with fullscreen opengl
      modes.
    * Fixed fire attacks of Demoness and Praevus drawing lines across
      the screen.
    * The annoying ".dynamic" extensions are removed from the binary names.
    * HexenWorld: dlsym'ed all calls to GL functions with
      SDL_GL_GetProcAddress.
    * Made the music automatically restart when changed in the options
      menu.
    * Heapsize is now 32768 default
    * The final splash screens now centre the messages properly.
    * Added an experimental SDL sound driver. Very buggy for now.
      (We acept patches ;)
    * Mouse grab in window modes, released with menus, pause and console.
      Mouse can be bound in the Options menu in window mode. "-nomouse"
      option works in window mode.


1.2.1: Changes since AoT 1.2.0:

    * New menu items for GL Glow, Chase mode, Draw Shadows.
    * GL glow patch from jshexen2.
    * Interactive video modes in software game disabled.
    * Video Modes menu now displays help message.
    * Height values corresponding to --width are properly added.
    * Screen sizes are selectable with "-width" and "-height" options,
      now. The "-mode" cmdline arg is removed.
    * Proper fullscreen mode(s) for OpenGL.
    * Two general overflow bug-fixes from pa3pyx.
    * BIG code cleanup including retiring some unused files, retiring
      old opengl files, killing many compiler warnings, etc.
    * A range checking bug is fixed along with the No Boss bug.
    * No Boss bug in Dan's original linux port fixed: Hexen2 loads
      progs2.dat along with progs.dat, as it should, now.
    * Probably some other minor things that we forgot.
