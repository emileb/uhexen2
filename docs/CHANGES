Changes since AoT 1.2.0:
------------------------

-   "No Boss" bug in Dan's original linux port fixed (Hexen2 now loads more
    than noe progsN.dat files).  As a bonus, a range checking bug is fixed
    alongside this one.
-   Proper fullscreen mode(s) for OpenGL.
-   Screen sizes are selectable with "-width" and "-height" options.
    The "-mode" cmdline arg is now removed.
-   Interactive video modes in software game disabled.
-   Video Modes menu now displays help message.
-   Height values corresponding to --width are properly added.
-   Mouse grab in window modes, released with menus, pause and console.
    Fixed so that mouse can be bound in the Options menu in window mode.
    Fixed "-nomouse" option works in window mode.
-   GL glow patch by JS.
-   New menu items for GL Glow, Chase mode, Draw Shadows.
-   Two general overflow bug-fixes by Pa3Pyx.
-   Heapsize is now 32768 default
-   An experimental SDL sound driver is added. Very buggy a.t.m., though.
-   The final splash screens now centre the messages properly.
-   Intermission screens are now drawn fullscreen (code from Pa3Pyx).
    This includes the help menu screen where the fonts were mostly
    unreadable.
-   Wheelmouse support is added.
-   The annoying ".dynamic" extensions are removed from the binary names.
-   Fixed textures going AWOL in GL mode upon loading savegames many times.
    This used to result in white info-plaques, for instance.
-   Fixed fire attacks of Demoness and Praevus used to draw lines across
    the screen.
-   Fixed the gl_other_glows option not being written into config.cfg
-   Made the music automatically restart when changed in the options menu.
-   Removed console spamming code (gl_extensions, unbinding files, etc.)
-   Now using glGetIntegerv to detect maximum supported texture size,
    not vendor string.
-   Building for pentium as default now.
-   BIG code cleanup including retiring some unused files, retiring ogl
    files without dlsym'ed gl functions, killing compiler warnings, etc.
-   Probably some other minor things that we forgot.
