ChangeLog:

2005-06-01 (CVS, 1.2.5-pre1):
     * SDL version >= 1.2.6 is now required. Updated the READMEs
       and added a version check at startup.
     * removed win32-only net function prototypes from linquake.h
       and updated linux_inc.h. also moved win32-only ipx netcode
       (this should fix the silly compile errors on bsd.)
     * updated a comment in Client/cl_main.c

2005-05-31 (CVS, 1.2.5-pre1):
     * ported player menu-texture handling, GL_LoadTexture
       and gl-filter changes from hexen2 to hexenworld.

2005-05-30 (CVS, 1.2.5-pre1):
     * updated commandline help display
     * removed obsoleted mkdir from hexenworld's Host_Init
     * added version and help strings to hwmaster
     * lowered the upper heapsize to 64 Mb for hwsv
     * version and help strings for hwsv (not much in help, but...)
     * moved hexenworld HOT_VERSION defines to bothdefs.h
     * consider this as 1.2.5-pre1

2005-05-29 (CVS):
     * Merged skyalpha of hexen2 to hexenworld
     * Added 2-tmu multitexture support (extracted from jshexen2):
       Doesn't work well with fxMesa (Voodoo2): "Unexpected dual
       texture mode encountered" all the time: Voodoo driver doesn't
       support many mtex modes (same goes for 3dfx DRI drivers). The
       particular problem we have is GL_MODULATE/GL_BLEND mode not
       being supported. GL_MODULATE/GL_DECAL is also missing which
       the patch uses for sky
     * Ported texture scale/upload and 8-bit extension functions of
       hexenworld to hexen2. This cures some corrupted textures while
       using paletted textures in hexen2
     * Killed gl_texsort (thus, R_DrawSequentailPoly & co) which was
       fairly broken
     * Reverted AoT changes to hexenworld's gl_rsurf
     * Synced some function and define names between h2 and h2w
     * A lot of whitespace clean-ups

2005-05-25 (CVS):
     * enabled mouse in whole of the options menu group
     * added basic multisampling support (GL_ARB_multisample),
       activated with -fsaa N. That D_ShowLoadingSize doesn't
       display anything with this on is the only issue
     * moved Mesa environment variable handling to gl_vidsdl where
       they belong
     * added a cmdline switch to enable vsync for nvidia users
     * made gl_vidsdl report stencil size as well
     * updated command-line help display
     * updated README for cmdline switches and tweaks
     * fixed small typos in README.3dfx

2005-05-23 (CVS):
     * search the mesh cache directly under com_userdir/glhexen,
       not in search_path. fixes the crazy polygons in mods bug.
     * added 3dfx documentation, updated BUGS.

2005-05-22 (CVS):
     * applied sbar fixes to hexenworld
     * changed default viewsize to 110
     * temporary fix for multiplayer episode selection.
       next time we should get rid of these H2MP defines
       and decide in runtime (com_portals from H2W?)
     * killed cvar sys_quake2 (I dont think anyone uses it)
     * conproc.* is for win32 only, moved them

2005-05-21 (CVS):
     * disabled the rotating skull annoyance in GL mode (used to cause
       problems with voodoo1/mesa6 when using gamma tricks)
     * Big mouse fix and clean-up:
     - revived -nomouse that "disables mouse no matter what"
     - renamed _windowed_mouse to _enable_mouse which is our intention,
       that is, dynamically disabling/enabling mouse while in game
     - old code had many oversights/leftovers that prevented mouse being
       really disabled in fullscreen mode. fixed and cleaned-up here
     - even in windowed mode, when mouse was disabled, mouse buttons and
       the wheel got processed. fixed it here.
     - mouse cursor is never shown while the game is alive, regardless
       of mouse being enabled/disabled (I never liked an ugly pointer
       around while playing) Its only intention would be to be able to
       use the desktop, and for that see, the grab notes below
     - if mouse is disabled, it is un-grabbed in windowed mode. Note: One
       can always use the keyboard shortcut CTRL-G for grabbing-ungrabbing
       the mouse regardless of mouse being enabled/disabled.
     - ToggleFullScreenSA() used to update vid_mode but always forgot
       modestate. It now updates modestate as well.
     - Now that IN_ActivateMouse() and IN_DeactivateMouse() are fixed,
       IN_ActivateMouseSA() and IN_DeactivateMouseSA() are redundant and
       are removed. BTW, I added a new qboolean mousestate_sa (hi Steve)
       which keeps track of whether we intentionally disabled the mouse.
     - mouse disabling in fullscreen mode (in the absence of -nomouse
       arg) is not allowed in this patch, but this is done by a if 1/if 0
       conditional compilation. Next patch will change all those if 1 to
       if 0, and voila!, we can fully disable/enable mouse in fullscreen.
     - moved modestate enums/defines to vid.h so that they can be used
       by other code properly.
     * enabled mouse when in console
     * re-enabled complete disabling/enabling of mousa in fullscreen mode
       (only replaced a bunch of if 1's to if 0's)
     * MINIMUM_MEMORY_LEVELPAK was never used, switched
       to MINIMUM_MEMORY
     * don't Sys_Error on bad -port cmdline argument
     * removed net_serial which has been dead for ages
     * synced wm caption code
     * more syncing of h2/hw vid_sdl and gl_vidsdl
     * fixed vid.h for VID_SetMode for win32

2005-05-20 (CVS):
     * Makefiles clean-up
     * synced h2 and hw versions of sound.h, moved
       two defines to protocol.h where they belong
     * synced h2 and hw versions of cd_linux.c (use the new H2W define)
     * synced h2 and hw versions of snd_dma.c (use the new H2W define)
     * synced h2 and hw versions of crc.c and crc.h
     * synced h2 and hw versions of midi stuff
     * save cache.txt and stats.txt into com_userdir
     * removed all unused IDGODS code
     * removed all unused (never used) non-RJNET and non-QUAKE2RJ code
     * removed all unused (never used) RJNETa and RJNET2 code
     * killed client->privileged (was only available to IDGODS)
     * initial syncing of common.c between h2 and hw: a lot of
       whitespace clean-up, removal of activision secure stuff,
       removal of -path, -proghack, -savedir and -cachedir support,
       better registered version detection and crc checks, etc.
     * removed some windows left-overs from sys_unix
     * separated winquake.h into winquake.h and linquake.h
       changed all occurances of winquake.h to quakeinc.h,
       which includes the correct header
     * keep ID style in declerations (less diff between h2/h2w...)
     * initial slight gl syncing: stripped the platform spesific
       stuff out from glquake.h into glxunix.h and glwin32.h
     * killed unused c_sky_polys in h2

2005-05-18 (CVS):
     * (Re-)added the parms.userdir to all sys_win.c. The platform
       conditionals around some of the com_userdir code of late are now
       unnecessary.
     * separated sys_unix.c and sys_win.c of hwsv to avoid many confusing
       conditionals
     * hopefully restored utils' compilability on win32: platform
       conditionals for includes; Q_strXcasecmp is now only for non
       __GNUC__, otherwise strXcasecmp is used.
     * updated mathlib.* of the utilities (removed underscored versions
       of the functions. dhcc doesnt even use the mathlib, updated its
       makefile...)
     * cleanup of "stricmp, strcmpi, strnicmp, Q_strcasecmp, Q_strncasecmp"
       mess: Q_strXcasecmp will now be used throughout the code which are
       implementation dependant defines for __GNUC__ (strXcasecmp) and
       _WIN32 (strXicmp)

2005-05-17 (CVS):
    * removed underscored versions of string comparison functions
    * removed unused underscored versions of math funcs
    * Q_strXXXXX is now only for !PLATFORM_UNIX
    * macroized some math functions (from Pa3PyX)
    * synced h2 and hw versions of mathlib.* (h2 now has some math
      functions inlined)
    * updated linux_inc.h for the changes above
    * removed unused backingbuf from vid_sdl.c (was a windows leftover)
    * removed some dead platform conditionals
    * reorganized x86 assembly files placement (shuffle practice ;)
    * initial cosmetic cleanups in menu.c and in_sdl.c
    * more obsoleted and/or win32 files clean-up

2005-05-07 (CVS):
    * Backed-out my silly mistake of removing light_level code
      in R_DrawViewModel
    * SV_StartSound should set SND_OVERFLOW, not SND_ATTENUATION.
      sound_num should be incremented/decremented by 256, not 255.
      (ran into this in quakesrc.org tutorials, by Kor Skarn, iirc)
    * Display platform in console background
    * [Hexenworld] Don't refuse to connect upon client/server VERSION
      mismatches. Such things should rely on PROTOCOL_VERSION not simply
      VERSION
2005-05-05 (CVS):
    * [hexenworld] save downloaded files to com_userdir
    * [h2/hw] profile save cleanup (and another MAX_OSPATH fix)
    * [opengl] report both requested and set video modes (matters for bpp)
2005-05-04 (CVS):
    * [launcher] cleanup the i++ mess and bump version slightly (v0.5.1)

2005-04-30 (CVS):
    * Always set the MESA_GLX_FX FX_DONT_FAKE_MULTITEX environment
      variables
    * "Fixed" (in fact, worked-around) Succubus' lightning weapon
      crashing the client if gcc4 compiled client is used, and/or
      the unused StreamEntities[MAX_STREAM_ENTITIES] is removed.
      Weird case..
    * Fixed hexenworld master server compile failure with gcc4
    * Socket length args of recvfrom and getsocklen should be of
      type socklen_t, not int (thanks go to gcc4)
    * Fixed two instances of the warning "dereferencing type-punned
      pointer will break strict-aliasing rules". Playing loose with
      pointers may not be safe
    * Fixed a statement with no effect in cl_tent.c of hwclient
    * Fixed an obscure demo playback bug which caused a fake freeze-
      like appearance when no next demos were found
    * Re-enabled fadescreen for fxMesa driver
    * Fixed a lot of gcc4 warnings about signedness mismatches
    * Silenced many instances of shadowed declarations
    * Removed a bunch of code from R_DrawViewModel(). R_DrawAliasModel()
      already does those things.
    * Removed int texture_mode which seemed to serve nothing
    * Changed texnum member of gltexture_t to be of unsigned int
      type rather than int (fixes a gcc4 warning)
    * Removed unnecessary global decl. of starttime in sys_unix.c
    * Switched to GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette and enabled paletted
      textures in hexen2. For paletted textures to work, the -paltex
      cmdline must be specified for both hexen2 and hexenworld.
    * Applied a big video cleanup patch:
    - Removed a lot of windoze left-overs, unused variables/cvars,
      functions using those vars/cvars serving no purpose (esp. those
      window_rect and window_center stuff, and more). There still are
      things in vid_sdl.c that need to be fully understood, they are
      there, for now.
    - The -window and -w cmdline args are now now removed: They did
      nothing, unless someone did some silly thing like using both -w
      and -f on the same cmdline.
    - The two mode-setting functions (windowed and f/s) are merged
    - The -height arg now is functional only if used in combination
      with -height. Since we only do normal modes, the width switch
      is replaced with the calculation  height = 3*width/4. Issue: We
      need some sanity check in case of both -width and -height args
      are specified
    - -bpp wasn't written into modenum[x].bpp, I did it here. As a
      side note, bpp doesn't affect anything, anyway.
    - The vidmode reporting code now displays the actual bpp value
      being set by SDL.
    - The code used to call VID_SetPalette() very multiple times in
      gl_vidsdl.c, they are now unified in VID_Init: After VID_SetMode,
      VID_SetPalette is called first, and then 8-bit palette if -paltex
      is specified. Note: Didn't touch vid_sdl.c in this manner, but DDOI
      (one of the guys during Dan's porting, perpahs) has a comment on
      a VID_SetPalette call being "Useless?"...
    - Updated gamma stuff: We don't use gamma ramps (in fact we can, we
      have SDL_SetGammaRamp), therefore eliminated V_CheckGamma & friends
      from V_UpdatePalette for PLATFORM_UNIX. Also killed unused function
      WarpPalette.

2005-04-15 (CVS):
    * Added working console input (from hexenworld server).
      Disabled console input in non-dedicated mode.
    * No dedicated server possible in hexenworld client.
    * Save memory.txt into com_userdir for sys_memory cmd.
    * Cure warning: cl_main.c: warning: `return' with no value,
      in function returning non-void
    * Shut up the compiler: gl_rsurf.c, gl_draw.c: warning: control
      reaches end of non-void function

2005-04-14 (CVS):
    * no need to announce MIDI_Cleanup if we'll never do it.
    * -? arg is back (Steve likes it ;)

2005-04-13 (CVS):
    * Removed useless -minmemory cmdline argument
    * Removed useless parms->memsize < minimum_memory check
      in Host_Init()
    * Added lower/upper boundaries (8mb/96mb) for -heapsize arg.
    * Added lower (48kb for hexen2, 256kb for hexenworld)/upper
      (1mb) boundaries for -zone argument (DYNAMIC_SIZE defs and
      zonesize requirements are different for hexen2 and hw.)
    * We won't die if no size is specified after -zone, but will
      ignore the arg.
    * Added null string terminations to hexen2 zone.c, so as to
      prevent garbage on sys_memory console command (found this
      in Pa3PyX)
    * tiny clean-up in COM_InitFilesystem (hexen2)
    * GAMENAME doesn't depend on QUAKE2 definition (hexen2)
    * made GL_Bind a macro (from Pa3PyX)

2005-04-10 (CVS):
    * Various MAX_OSPATH fixes
    * Added version string to hwmaster initialization display
    * Added user directory support to hwmaster. filters.ini will
      now be processed in ~/.hwmaster as ~/.hwmaster/filters.ini
    * Added FreeBSD to VERSION_PLATFORM
    * Bumped the version to 1.2.5 for a new future release,
      updated the specfile

2005-04-09 (CVS):
    * Removed scankey[] and MapKey(), unused for
      SDL/PLATFORM_UNIX
    * More unused/cosmetic clean-ups in vidsdl

2005-04-08 (CVS):
    * added Pa3PyX' fire delay bits for paladin's setstaff
      (gamedata-1.14)
    * removed useless is_PowerVR and isPermedia and unused
      vertex array extension checking from hexenworld
    * 3dfx stuff initial clean-up
    * whitespace cosmetics in gl_vidsdl.c
    * Merged a new R_PolyBlend code (from jshexen2).  Also
      added the GL_DoGamma function (to be called from
      R_PolyBlend) which brightens the display. Commented out
      for now. This little gem can be used to adjust gamma for
      Voodoo1/2/Rush.
    * Enable 8-bit gl extensions only if explicitly required
      by the user (-paltex cmdline arg.) Otherwise, fxMesa is
      rendering is borked, at least with Mesa-3.4.2 on RH-7.3
      in my experience.
    * Added -old3dfx cmdline check. For now, I use it to set
      the MESA_GLX_FX environment variable to "f" and to disable
      fxMesa fake multitexturing. Further future uses possible.

2005-04-06 (CVS):
    * hexenworld/opengl: fixed non-dlsymmed use of some gl
      functions. also fixed a truely silly copy+paste error

2005-04-05 (CVS):
    * dropped the -march=i386 -mcpu=i686 flag: causes problems
      at least on old pentiums with old distros.  going with
      plain -march=i586
    * we dlsym the gl functions and still use -lGL -lGLU ?!!
      bad.. bad....
    * cleaned-up endianness which is now decided at compile time
    * fadescreen ripple effect may stop help/quit screens from
      appearing on 3dfx with Mesa Glide. (from Steve)
    * 3dfx voodoo detection when using Mesa Glide (from Steve)
    * quakeized and added a comment to ToggleFullScreenSA
    * removed my previous restrictions about adding userpaths
      to the searchpath (was added in 1.2.3)
    * Save recorded demos, progs profiles, console debug logs
      and all server logs, etc to com_userdir, not com_gamedir.
      Otherwise these operations shall fail on a system-wide
      installation unless the user is super user.
    * dwarf class was never enabled in hexenworld/siege menu
      system, because com_gamedir is not only a naked dirname
      but a full pathname
    * removed a few quake1 leftovers from hexenworld
    * imported the hexenworld master server 1.2 sources (by
      Marc Allaire, aka. Kor Skarn) into the cvs
    * fixed gcc2 compilation of hwmaster
    * merged a stdin code for hwmaster that doesn't eat 100%
      of the cpu (adapted from quakeforge)
    * added compile instructions for the gamecode
    * updated the specfile for our new loki_patch package

2005-03-24 (CVS):
    * simplified window title creation in launcher
    * fixed a harmless typo in launcher, for correctness' sake

2005-03-19 (CVS):
    * added back the md5sum data for the data1/pak?.pak files
      to the README
    * imported the utility sources to the CVS. how I forgot
      doing that for months is a mystery
    * merged an H2MP 1.12-1.12a axtail patch to the gamecode
      which has been missing in the CVS somehow

2005-03-14 (CVS):
    * updated the build_all scripts
    * small sbar resizing fix in software mode (from Steven)
    * added back console video mode reporting. also removed the
      non-functional findbpp

2005-03-08 (CVS):
    * fixed an oversight in reinit_music which resulted in a
      needless restart of midi music upon pressing Esc twice

1.2.4: Changes since HoT-1.2.3:
2005-03-06:
    * Release 1.2.4-final
    * Added bsd includes to snd_oss.c
    * Added net sanity checks (from Steven)
    * Moved reinit_music to menu.c where it belongs
    * Fixed reinit_music so that it works for the F4 key as well
    * Don't mess with music volume on every frame update, it's
      just silly

2005-03-05 (CVS, 1.2.4-rc5):
    * OSS (and ALSA): Try to use what frequency is actually set:
      I first naively thought that requested-provided frequency
      mismatches wouldn't happen, but I got one weird oss report
      which includes this case. Let's see what this does now...
    * OSS: if failures are hit after mmaping shm->buffer, munmap
      it before quitting

2005-03-03 (CVS, 1.2.4-rc4):
    * fixed and activated munmap of shm->buffer for snd_oss.c
    * commented-out shm->gamealive thing which serves nothing
    * sys_unix.c cleanup: remove dead and/or win32 code
    * removed unreached return from main (it should have been 0,
      btw. from Steve)
    * increased MAX_OSPATH to 256 (from Steve)
    * Sys_Mkdir is now int. Its return code should be checked in
      other places, too (from Steve).
    * Sys_GetUserdir now uses $HOME instead of the passwd struct
      (from Steve)
    * removed h2mp dependency from length check in Sys_GetUserdir,
      seems to serve no purpose (from Steve)

2005-02-23 (CVS, 1.2.4-rc3):
    * final rc for 1.2.4
    * killed hexenworld warning "cl_tent.c:2972: warning: statement
      with no effect". at last we decided that this guy intended |=,
      not &=
    * merged a bunch of hcode (gameplay) fixes/adjustments from Pa3PyX'
      sources which brings the gamecode version to 1.12g.

2005-02-20 (CVS, 1.2.4-rc2):
    * H2MP: Old mission option is now always enabled, removed my
      cmdline thing, killed the cvar m_oldmission;  completely
      disabled the demoness for the old mission, killed my cvar
      m_demoness.
    * Sound: Now processing all command line options in snd_dma.c,
      S_Startup only, targets will do to its bidding first; don't
      die immediately, try setting alternative hw parameters;
      (fwiw, snd_oss.c now applies all hardware settings before
      mmaping the buffer); added a check for requested and set rate
      mismatches which fails S_Startup if found (found it in alsa
      examples, is it necessary at all? commented out for now.)
    * OpenGL: Added comments on gl_picmip scale-down and ugly help
      screens (Steven)
    * H2/HW: Added the new sound options to the help messages
    * Documents: Updated the README files
    * Launcher: New version 0.5.0:  added all sound cmdline options
      (sampling rate, format, stereo); removed "disable joystick"
      option (not functional in the engine for ages); removed the
      "old mission" thing (already made always-enabled in the engine);
      changed Mission Pack checkbox into a radio button grouped with
      the others; added Hexen2 bot mods as extra game types similar
      to hexenworld game types; redesigned the interface: default is
      basic mode which displays the basic options necessary only, a
      new "More" button expands the interface to show more things;
      replaced the resolution slider with a combo; gtk-2 is default
      now, to build for gtk-1.2 type make GTK1=yes.

2005-02-14 (CVS, 1.2.4-rc1):
    * added ability to disable ALSA support at compile time
    * fix mouse not being activated after connecting to a server in
      windowed mode for hexenworld. from Steve.
    * oss sound improvements (from the quakeforge project):
      - retry 3 times opening /dev/dsp
      - open O_NONBLOCK
      - check pagesize when mmaping
      - reset /dev/dsp when closing it (from the twilight project)
    * alsa sound improvements:
      - more error checking and detailed error reporting
      - replicate the order in quakeforge as much as possible

2005-02-12 (CVS):
    * more general clean-up:
      - delete dead win32 code from linux files
      - Kill sound/music messing in vid code: S_Init() and CDAudio_Init()
        are called AFTER VID_Init(), so this should be correct.
        See hexen2/host.c for reasoning on Win32.
      - we can never reach CheckTextureExtensions(), we'll give up
        in GL_Init_Functions() if we don't like the gl_library...
      - also comment out CheckArrayExtensions(), its call is if0'ed out
    * added 48000 to the alsa rate switch
    * added paranoid sound driver checks
    * added missing scrolltitle in the software version of VID_MenuDraw()

2005-02-10 (CVS):
    * removed unused functions SV_SaveEffects, SV_LoadEffects,
      SV_RemoveGIPFiles and SV_CopyFiles from hwsv.
    * fixed a typo in hwcl software draw code
    * fixed a format warning in hwsv

2005-02-09 (CVS):
    * killed a bunch of compiler warnings
    * killed all unused HW menu stuff

2005-02-08 (CVS):
    * video modes clean-up:
      - removed cvar _vid_default_mode_win

      - removed all nummodes and VID_NumModes stuff
      - removed all VID_GetXXX and VID_DescXXX stuff
      - beautified the Video Modes menu screen a little
      - removed firstupdate things (VID_Update() in vid_sdl.c)
    * tiny whitespace cleanup in in_sdl.c
    * draw alpha console background in Hexen2 (Draw_AlphaPic() from HW)
    * if0-out fxPalTexImage2D (we don't use it)
    * display the "meshing XXX" spam for developers only

2005-02-06 (CVS):
    * first sketchy update to the README files regarding
      the recent sound changes
    * move cd_win.c and resource.h to ./win_stuff/
    * tiny makefiles cleanup
    * tiny log entries cleanup in snd_sdl.c, midi_sdl.c

2005-02-05 (CVS):
    * fixed silly copy+paste error in snd_alsa.c
    * fixed demo builds of the launcher
    * fastsqrt.cpp isn't used for ages, moved it to ./obsolete/
    * separated win32 and linux versions of midi files, too much
      mess otherwise
    * midi file paths cleanup: they should have been leftovers
      from times when gamedir and userdir were the same
    * killed Com_WriteFileFullPath(), not used anymore
    * replaced some Con_Printf() with Sys_Printf() in midi_sdl.c
    * added midi volume control (partially from Pa3PyX)
    * updated the midi stuff (volume ctrl, etc) for win32, too
    * fixed possible path length overflows in midi_sdl.c

    * ported all midi changes from hexen2 to hexenworld
    * applied the HexenWorld specific changes to midi_sdl.c and
      enabled midi in the HW makefiles. who knows why it didn't
      work in aot before...

2005-02-04 (CVS):
    * made sdl_audio actually work (finally)
    * some snd_dma.c fixes from the tenebrae project
    * killed fakedma (simsound). one less thing to worry about
    * fixed cd music stops playing on volume change (reported
      by Julien Langer)
    * added actual cdrom volume control via CDROMVOLCTRL.
      cdrom isn't paused when the user volume is 0, anymore
      (should have been a trick to silence the cdrom before
      this control was present). BSD ioctls may be different,
      add conditionals for it one day...
    * added ALSA sound driver (from the quakeforge project)
    * we now build all all the sound drivers in and choose from
      the command line. oss is default

    * merged small bits from the hw version of midi.c into h2
    * small whitespace cleanups in snd_oss.c, snd_mem.c, snd_dma.c,
      cd_linux.c. Heavy whitespace changes in midi.c, midi.h.

    * game hcode:
      - added Raven's Siege hcode

    * gl filter changes

2005-01-23 (CVS):
    * Hexen2/HW: support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 (patch from
      Julien Langer) Let's see if this behaves for everybody.
    * Launcher:  search for known hexenworld game-types and
      provide a list menu. v0.4.8.

1.2.3: Changes since HoT-1.2.2:
2005-01-20
    * Release 1.2.3-final

2005-01-18/19 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc8):
    * Hexen2/HexenWorld:
    - Fixed userdirs to work correctly against the -game arg.
    - Added "qboolean adduser" arg to COM_AddGameDir() (useful esp.
      in HW):  com_userdir evolves gradually. Every search path
      added has a consequence of additon of (multiple) unnecessary
      userpaths. Avoid it where we can. (original aot also added the
      very same userdir multiple times)
    - Changed all instances of "id1" to "data1"
    * Game Launcher (major changes):
    - Fixed (hopefully) fork() / execv()
    - Removed clumsy renderer selection, toggling ogl is enough.
    - Removed res-buttons, made a slider, more compact interface.
    - Made lower/upper bounds of the res-scale renderer-dependant.
    - Disallowed launching when proper binary is absent. Added a
      statusbar which notifies the user for this.
    - Removed already commented-out demoness-in-old-mission.
    - Put the widgets to be played with remotely are put in to
      structs properly for easier handling. The binary output is
      even smaller now.
    - For Gtk2.0 builds, replaced gtk_widget_set_usize() with
      gtk_widget_set_size_request()
    - Much code clean-up (apparently)
    - Removed gtk_widget_set_uposition(). We seem to do fine with
      gtk_fixed_put().
    - Hacked the version number into the window title.  [v0.4.6]
    - Combined a bunch of on_ThisEvent() type callback functions
      which had been doing the same  x = !x  thing
    - Fixed / cleaned-up config_file.c.
    - Version 0.4.7.

2005-01-13 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc7):

    * Fix off-by-one error in demo ending message line calculation.
    * Fixed mouse behavior which was always broken in hexen2-linux.
      Middle-button is MOUSE2, right-button is MOUSE3, not vice versa
      (see SDL_mouse.h). The wheelmouse patch fixed this a little, but
      introduced a mouse2/mouse3 fight in in_sdl.c. It is fixed here.
    * Fixed the debug message about undefined mouse buttons.
    * Did some syncing between H2 and HW versions of input files.
    * Misc cleanups (nitpicking/polishing).

2005-01-08 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc6):

    * don't die on cache mismatch, delete and and reload the new
      texture.
    * slight gl clean-ups.

2005-01-07 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc5):

    * _windowed_mouse default is 1 in gl mode, too.
    * bind Alt+Enter combination to Steven's stuff for fullscreen-
      windowed toggling

2005-01-03 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc4):

    * gl_ztrick disabled by default for hexenworld, too
    * Also compiled against glibc-2.2 with gcc-2.96 (on rh-7.3) and
      included properly in the installer.
    * Fixed a compilation error in case of gcc-2.96

2005-01-02 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc3):

    * Retired AoT, aot and .aot: Change userdir (AOT_USERDIR) to .hexen2
      (for the demo, it's .hexen2demo)
    * Added clarifications about network-compatibility in the docs.
    * Code clean-up in Hexen2 and Launcher. Big clean-up in Hexenworld.

2004-12-29 (CVS, 1.2.3-rc2):

    * Launcher: Some usability tweaks. Removed the mouse option, added
      the disable networking option.
    * Hexen2: Fullscreen/Windowed mode is now switchable. Seems to work
      good. (from Steven).
    * Hexen2: Mouse can now be disabled for fullscreen modes (from Steven).
    * HexenWorld Client: Merge some Hexen2 changes:
      o Fix the fire attacks drawing lines across the screen
      o Don't print gl_extensions which spams the console
      o Partially merge Steven's mouse tweaks from 2004-12-29.

2004-12-28 (CVS):

    * Fixed gameplay issue: Holy item in the Cathedral balcony not
      reachable (automatic install using the installer).
    * Fixed (mostly) gameplay issue: Eidolon loses hostility under
      certain conditions (automatic install using the installer).
    * Fixed gameplay issue: Eidolon fails landing (automatic install
      using the installer).
    * Prepared an installer (using loki_setup tools from CVS / 
      2004-12-26).
    * The Launcher works fine with GTK2 now.
    * Using redhat rpm style arch flags ( -march=i386 -mcpu=i686 ).
    * Fixed textures going AWOL in GL mode upon loading savegames many
      times. This used to result in white info-plaques, for instance
      (adapted from pa3pyx).
    * The "GL GLOWS" menu entry is fixed. It now controls
      gl_other_glows, too.
    * Fixed the gl_other_glows option not being written into config.cfg
    * Previous Weapon entry added to the Customize Controls menu.
    * Removed second arg from the function EmitSkyPolys.
    * Use glGetIntegerv to detect maximum supported texture size, not
      vendor string.
    * gl_max_size is not a cvar anymore. Also killed cvar gl_nobind.
    * Merge newer snd_dma code from HexenWorld to Hexen2.
    * Intermission screens now drawn fullscreen (from pa3pyx).
      This includes the help menu screen where the fonts seemed
      unreadably small.
    * Wheelmouse support is added.
    * Removed console spamming code (gl_extensions, unbinding files, etc.)


1.2.2: Changes since HoT 1.2.1:

    * Launcher is fully functional and works fine with fullscreen opengl
      modes.
    * Fixed fire attacks of Demoness and Praevus drawing lines across
      the screen.
    * The annoying ".dynamic" extensions are removed from the binary names.
    * HexenWorld: dlsym'ed all calls to GL functions with
      SDL_GL_GetProcAddress.

      menu.
    * Heapsize is now 32768 default
    * The final splash screens now centre the messages properly.
    * Added an experimental SDL sound driver. Very buggy for now.
      (We acept patches ;)
    * Mouse grab in window modes, released with menus, pause and console.
      Mouse can be bound in the Options menu in window mode. "-nomouse"
      option works in window mode.


1.2.1: Changes since AoT 1.2.0:

    * New menu items for GL Glow, Chase mode, Draw Shadows.
    * GL glow patch from jshexen2.
    * Interactive video modes in software game disabled.
    * Video Modes menu now displays help message.
