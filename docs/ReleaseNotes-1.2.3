Hexen II for Linux: Hammer of Thyrion 1.2.3
===========================================

Changes since HoT-1.2.2:

General:
  - The user directory is ~/.hexen2 for the full version
    and ~/.hexen2demo for the demo version, from now on.
  - The demo ending screen message is fixed.

Game Launcher:
  - Highly fixed and tweaked, and also built a GTK2 version.

Installer:
  - Prepared graphical installers for both retail and demo
    versions. The retail installer handles all the copying
    from cdrom and patching jobs.
  - Also prepared binaries against glibc-2.2.5 (using gcc-
    2.96 on RedHat-7.3) and placed into the installer.

GamePlay Fixes (automatically
available from the installer):
  - Typo fixes in strings.txt of Hexen2.
  - Holy item in the Cathedral balcony was not reachable
    (reduced the game's teleport-pushing speed.)
  - Eidolon lost his hostility under certain conditions
    (merged newer eidolon code of the mission pack.)
  - Eidolon would fail landing after his initial jump.
(If you're not using the installer, separate downloads
 from the HoT site are necessary.)

Documentation:
  - Clarifications on network compatibility.
  - Several other updates.

Menu:
  - Fixed GL Glows menu item and made it control
    gl_other_glows, too.
  - New menu item for "Previous Weapon".
  - New menu item for Fullscreen/Windowed toglling.

Input:
  - Wheelmouse support added.
  - Mouse2/Mouse3 buttons behavior is fixed.
  - _windowed_mouse also defaults to 1 for opengl version.
  - Mouse can now be disabled for fullscreen modes.

Sound:
  - Merged slightly newer snd_dma code from HexenWorld to
    Hexen2 (small changes, though.)

Filesystem:
  - Hexen2/HW now correctly honor the -game argument for
    the user directories.

General Graphics:
  - Intermission screens are drawn fullscreen even on high
    resolutions. This includes the Help screens.

OpenGL:
  - Texture delete/reload support.
  - No more dying on texture cache mismatches.
  - Fixed textures going missing sometimes.
  - gl_ztrick also disabled by default in HexenWorld.
  - Fixed gl_other_glows option not being written into config.
  - Maximum texture size is now detected using glGetIntegerv,
    not vendor string.
  - Removed second arg from the function EmitSkyPolys().
  - Several other cleanups.

Source Code:
  - Big source code cleanup.
  - More merges of fixes/features from hexen2 to hexenworld.

Build System;
  - Using redhat rpm style arch flags (-march=i386 -mcpu=i686).
