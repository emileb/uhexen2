Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uHexen2)
Release Notes for version 1.5.4 (May 16, 2012.)
================================================

Changes since the uhexen2-1.5.3 release:

* OpenGL: Fixed screen flickering resulting from progress bars drawing
  with some drivers (bug #3519666.) uHexen2 no longer draws the loading
  progress bars during level load in opengl mode.
* OpenGL (Windows): Fixed a bug which would prevent running on Windows8
  consumer preview versions, unless 32 bit color depth was specified on
  the command line. Works just fine now.
* Music playback: Made sure that the file's channels count is supported.
* Client, all: Revised the intermissions setup code.
* Linux/Unix (SDL): Added joystick (gamepad) support. The new cvars are
  documented in the README file.
* Mouse (DOS): Wheel is now detected and used by default. Use "-nowheel"
  command line switch to disable it.
* Mouse (DOS): Pausing the game, moving the mouse and then unpausing it,
  doesn't change the view angle anymore.
* Utils, dcc (progs decompiler): Fixed an infinite recursion issue when
  decompiling the hcbots progs.dat. Made the -src command line option of
  dhcc behave the same as it does with hcc.
* Utils, hcc (HexenC compiler): Cleaned up the -src command line option
  handling.
* All: Incremented versions for the hexen2 engine to 1.26 and hexenworld
  engine to 0.26.
* Several source code cleanups and documentation updates.
