Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uHexen2)
Release Notes for version 1.5.4 (Apr. 23, 2012.)
================================================

Changes since the uhexen2-1.5.3 release:

* OpenGL: Fixed screen flickering resulting from progress bars drawing
  with some drivers (bug #3519666.) uHexen2 no longer draws the loading
  progress bars during level load in opengl mode.
* Music playback: Made sure that the file's channels count is supported.
* Client, all: Revised the intermissions setup code.
* All: Incremented versions for the hexen2 engine to 1.26 and hexenworld
  engine to 0.26.
* Several source code cleanups.
