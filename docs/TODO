Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

TODO:
---------------------------

- Add a pak-patch application for Mac OS X.
- Revise the gtk launcher GUI.
- Add joystick support through sdl
- Re-visit the messy mouse grab code and clean it up.
- Do a clean-up of the opengl system
- Add multisampling support to win32
- Maybe add support for several image formats (jpeg, png, etc)
- Maybe add model interpolation stuff?
- Software renderer: maybe add 16 bit support (r_pixbytes = 2,
  and even 4 for 32 bit)? The current code is largely missing
  translucency pieces and the d_8to16 and d_8to24 translation
  tables.
- Net: Find some way to workaround the infamous router troubles
- HexenWorld: Spectator mode (chasecam) isn't as it should be,
  compare with the quakeworld code and fix.
- MorphOS: the port isn't touched since 1.4.0-prerelease times,
  make sure it still works out of the box.
- Maybe do other ports? (Amiga, etc?)
- Does Solaris compile / work?
- Add sound font support to Timidity.
- Add sequencer (mpu-401) support for midi (alsa / oss)
- DOS: Implement MIDI music playback.
- DOS: Implement loading progress bars.
- Utilities: Add pthread support and revise the current windows
  threads mess. Threads need't be for alpha-only.
- utils/jsh2colour: clean-up the huge mess and improve a bit.
- utils/maputils: improvements on the light tool?
- utils/texutils: add some more texture tools (pcx2wal, etc.) ?
- More unification of hexen2 and hexenworld trees
