Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uHexen2)

TODO:
-------------------------------------

- Add a pak-patch application for Mac OS X.
- Re-visit the messy mouse grab code and clean it up.
- Do a clean-up of the opengl code and modernize it.
- Add multisampling support to win32
- Maybe add support for several image formats (jpeg, png, etc)
- Maybe add model interpolation stuff?
- Software renderer: maybe add 16 bit support (r_pixbytes = 2,
  and even 4 for 32 bit)? The current code is largely missing
  translucency pieces and the d_8to16 and d_8to24 translation
  tables.
- Net: Find some way to workaround the infamous router troubles
- Add sound font support to Timidity.
- ALSA, OSS: Add sequencer support for MIDI playback.
- DOS: Implement MIDI music playback (MPU-401, AdLib/FM synth.)
- utils, light: improvements?
- utils, texutils: add more texture tools (pcx2wal, etc.)?
- More unification of hexen2 and hexenworld trees
- HexenWorld: Spectator mode (chasecam) isn't as it should be,
  compare with quakeworld code and fix?
