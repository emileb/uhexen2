---------------------------

- Add joystick support through sdl
- Add pthread support to the utilities
- Do a clean-up of the opengl system
- Add sequencer support for midi
- More thorough checking of the tree for 64-bit platforms
- More thorough checking of the tree for big-endian platforms
- More thorough checking of the tree for const-correctness
- Make the software renderer "intel-free" someday
- Re-write midi code for wildmidi and /or remove the SDL_mixer
  dependancy: I don't like opening the sound device twice.
- Add multisampling support to win32
- More unification of hexen2 and hexenworld trees
- Re-visit the extra patches, fix and merge (e.g.: fog, etc.)
