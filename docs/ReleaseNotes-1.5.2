Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uhexen2)
Release Notes for version 1.5.2 (Feb. 15, 2012.)
================================================

Changes since the uhexen2-1.5.1 release:

* All platforms: Incremented versions for the hexen2 engine
  to 1.25, hexenworld engine to 0.25, gamecode to 1.25 and
  the gtk-launcher to 1.0.7.
* Verified correct compilation by clang (using v3.0.)
* All platforms, gamecode: Fixed occasional crashes in the
  original hexen2 game with the Paladin's axe.
* All platforms, hexen2 net play: fixed connection getting
  stuck sometimes after displaying the "Connection accepted"
  message.
* All platforms: Ported server model code optimizations and
  cleanups from h2ded to hwsv (hexenworld server).
* All platforms: Added support for transparent console in
  the software renderer, controlled by new cvar "contrans".
  Valid values for contrans are 0 (solid), 1 (transparent)
  and 2 (very transparent).
* All platforms, software renderer: Fixed wrong transparency
  issue with certain models when not using the x86 assembler
  drawing routines.
* All platforms: Added on-screen fps counter to hexen2 (do
  "showfps 1" from the console).  Updated existing showfps
  code of hexenworld.
* All platforms, OpenGL: Added anisotropic texture filtering
  support (gl_texture_anisotropy). Revised existing texture
  filters. Texture filtering options now saved to the config.
* All platforms: Implemented fov in opengl hexen2, useful
  for widescreen resolutions. Revised the implementations
  in hexenworld, as well as the software renderer.
* All platforms, input: Discard mouse/joystick motion when
  in cameramode. Discard the accumulated mouse motion when
  starting a game or when loading a saved game to prevent
  any unintended viewangle changes.
* Windows input: Disabled GDI mouse acceleration flags for
  better behavior on XP and newer versions.
* SDL / Unix: Revised SDL unicode and dead keys support.
* SDL / Mac OS X: Fixed console and message mode backspace
  key (bug #2688151.)
* Unix / SVGAlib mouse: Fixed missing camera mode and ideal
  roll handling.
* Unix / SVGAlib video: Fixed planar modes when using the
  svgalib_helper kernel module. Removed the need for x86
  assembly for compilation and the linux-only limitation.
* Unix / SVGAlib video: Fixed messed up colors upon coming
  back from a vt switching.
* Unix, MIDI: Several updates to the Timidity backend.
* Timidity, Windows MIDI: Support for Microsoft RMID format.
* Windows MIDI: Fixed broken tempo with certain midi files
  (problem was introduced in version 1.5.1)
* Windows software renderer: Fixed restoring of the saved
  video mode on startup (problem was introduced in v1.4.4.)
* All platforms: Removed code that prevented deathmatch and
  coop cvars to be set at the same time, which was reported
  for possibility of causing compatibility issues with mods.
* All platforms: Majorly revised the support mechanism for
  different versions of progs. Added old v1.03 progs support
  to hexen2, added old v0.11 and v0.14 progs support to hw.
* All platforms, h2ded: Removed error when neither coop nor
  deathmatch is set and rely on server admin.
* All platforms, hexenworld client: Fixed a crash in the
  credits display when one waited long enough to see all the
  text to be printed.
* Unix / gtk-launcher: Added support for gtk3. Several bug
  fixes and code cleanups.
* Mac OS X: Fixed compilation failure due to a typo in MIDI
  code introduced in v1.5.1.
* DOS: Added WatTCP (WATT-32) networking support for hexen2
  internet play.
* DOS: Added experimental DOS support for hexenworld using
  WATT-32 library.
* DOS: Added "-nogus" command line option so that UltraSound
  initialization can be skipped by the user if necessary.
* Miscellaneous source code cleanups.
