Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uhexen2)
Release Notes for version 1.5.2 (Jan. 21, 2012.)
================================================

Changes since the uhexen2-1.5.1 release:

* All platforms: Incremented versions for the hexen2 engine
  to 1.25, hexenworld engine to 0.25 and gamecode to 1.25.
* All platforms, gamecode: Fixed occasional crashes in the
  original hexen2 game with the Paladin's axe.
* All platforms: Ported server model code optimizations and
  cleanups from h2ded to hwsv (hexenworld server).
* All platforms: Added support for transparent console in
  the software renderer, controlled by new cvar "contrans".
  Valid values for contrans are 0 (solid), 1 (transparent)
  and 2 (very transparent).
* All platforms: Added on-screen fps counter to hexen2 (do
  "showfps 1" from the console).  Updated existing showfps
  code of hexenworld.
* All platforms: Implemented fov in opengl hexen2, useful
  for widescreen resolutions. Revised the implementations
  in hexenworld, as well as the software renderer.
* All platforms, input: Discard mouse/joystick motion when
  in cameramode. Discard the accumulated mouse motion when
  starting a game or when loading a saved game to prevent
  any unintended viewangle changes.
* SDL / Unix: Revised SDL unicode and dead keys support.
* Linux / SVGAlib mouse: Fixed missing camera mode and ideal
  roll handling.
* Unix, MIDI: Several updates to the Timidity backend.
* Timidity, Windows MIDI: Support for Microsoft RMID format.
* Windows MIDI: Fixed broken tempo with certain midi files
  (problem was introduced in version 1.5.1)
* All platforms: Removed code that prevented deathmatch and
  coop cvars to be set at the same time, which was reported
  for possibility of causing compatibility issues with mods.
* All platforms, h2ded: Removed error when neither coop nor
  deathmatch is set and rely on server admin.
* All platforms, hexenworld client: Fixed a crash in the
  credits display when one waited long enough to see all the
  text to be printed.
* Mac OS X: Fixed compilation failure due to a typo in MIDI
  code introduced in v1.5.1.
* DOS: Added WatTCP (WATT-32) networking support for hexen2
  internet play.
* DOS: Added experimental DOS support for hexenworld using
  WATT-32 library.
* DOS: Added "-nogus" command line option so that UltraSound
  initialization can be skipped by the user if necessary.
* Miscellaneous source code cleanups.
