Hexen II Launcher for linux / unix
with GTK+ interface. Version 0.9.0
----------------------------------

Place the launcher binary into the directory that you installed
Hammer of Thyrion v1.4.1.  Execute it and enjoy. You can also
create a symlink for it in a directory on your path.  Examples:

# ln -s /usr/local/games/hexen2/h2launcher  /home/my_name/bin/hexen2

  or:

# ln -s /usr/local/games/hexen2/h2launcher  /usr/local/bin/hexen2

  or:

# ln -s /usr/games/hexen2/h2launcher  /usr/bin/hexen2

This way, you can run the game launcher simply by typing "hexen2"
from any place.

This version of the Hexen II Launcher has the integrated ability
of patching the retail cdrom pak files to Raven's 1.11 version.
It utilizes xdelta-1.1.3 / 1.1.4 libraries, which are included
in the Hammer of Thyrion sources since 1.4.2-pre1. In its present
form it is fully functional, but it may still be improved:

TODO:
----------

- Allow cancelling the patch operation: needs playing with signals
  and pthread_cancel stuff.

- Allow running the patch operation as super-user: If the game is
  installed system-wide, this would be nice.

COMPILING:
----------

1.  First compile the included xdelta library:

	cd xdelta11
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --disable-shared
	make

    Note: If you want to build it against glib-1.2.x instead
    of glib-2.x, use the --disable-glib2 switch when configuring,
    e.g.: ./configure --disable-shared --disable-glib2

2. Compile the launcher normally:

	cd launcher
	make

    Note: If you want to build it against gtx-1.2.x instead of
    gtk-2.x, you must compile xdelta against glib-1.2.x (see
    above). Then do: make GTK1=yes
