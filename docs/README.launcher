Linux Hexen2 Launcher

Place the launcher binary into the directory that you installed
Hammer of Thyrion (v1.2.5).  Execute it and enjoy.  You can also
create a symlink for it in a dir on your path.  You can then run
it from any place.  Examples:

# ln -s /usr/local/games/hexen2/h2launcher  /home/my_name/bin/hexen2

  or:

# ln -s /usr/local/games/hexen2/h2launcher  /usr/local/bin/hexen2

  or:

# ln -s /usr/games/hexen2/h2launcher  /usr/bin/hexen2
