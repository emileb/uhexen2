Hammer of Thyrion,
HexenWorld Server

Server Modes:
--------------

There are different modes that you can run your HexenWorld server in.
These are only for unmodified hexenworld. Some community created mods,
such as the Ghost mod, may modify the meaning and behavior of these
options. This is not a complete listing, more may be found on the net.


Mission Pack support:
---------------------

HexenWorld looks for the Portal of Praevus mission pack and automatically
activates it if it finds it. If, for some reason, you want to disable the
mission pack support, run the server with -noportals commandline switch.


Setting up Map Cycling:
-----------------------

Only the server needs to do this. Using your favorite text editor, open the
file named strings.txt in your hw directory:
- Go to the end of the file.
- You will see four warning lines there, the first one says:
  <1.you passed the end of the file, pal>
  The second and the rest differ only by the starting number, ie 2, 3 and 4.
  These lines MUST always stay at the end of the file! Never delete or edit
  them in any way!
- Just before the first warning line, insert two new lines: The first one
  must be map_sequence_start, and the second one must be map_sequence_end .
- Between these two new lines, add the list of the maps you want to cycle,
  one map name on each line. Map names must stay between map_sequence_start
  and map_sequence_end.  Do not edit any other part of the file!
- No empty lines, or lines with spaces only, are allowed. Extra spaces are
  not allowed.
- Any number of maps can be put in it.
- Only the first occurence of a map name is used to determine next map,
  therefore use a mapname only once.
- If the server is running a map that is not in the list the same map will
  reload when game ends.
- When server reaches the end of the list, it goes back to the start of
  of the list: looping is enabled.
- As an example, see the strings.txt file in the hw directory provided
  by Hammer of Thyrion.
- If you want to disable map cycling you just created, remove the all the
  map entries and the map_sequence_start and map_sequence_end headers from
  strings.txt .
