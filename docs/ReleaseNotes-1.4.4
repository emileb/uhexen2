Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uhexen2), CVS snapshot / pre-release,
Version 1.4.4-pre4 / Jan. 01, 2009.

Changes since the HoT-1.4.3 release:

* bumped the hexen2 engine version to 1.22, and hexenworld engine version
  to 0.22.
* fixed the broken software renderer binaries from C++ compilers with x86
  assembly enabled (do not use the bool keyword of C++).
* compilations using the gcc-4.4 development versions were tested.
* added support for 64 bit windows versions (x64) using mingw-w64.
* stricter checking on the values pulled out of .wav file chunk headers.
* renamed model_t to qmodel_t in order to avoid conflicts on solaris.
* fixed 'array going out-of-bounds' (utils/map.c) and bogus 'maybe used
  uninitialized' warnings (sbar.c) from gcc-4.3.
* fixes to the SVGALib driver. it is functional now.
* fixed bug #2176384: in windowed mode, when you save using the menus, the game
  used to quit the menu without grabbing the mouse properly.
* increased the buffersize for sdl audio. made it to print a little more
  detailed info at startup.
* launcher, patching: rewritten the inter-threads log printing and fixed the
  erratic crashes on smp systems. launcher version is 1.0.4 now.
* hexenworld master server: unknown packets are properly output as hexdump.
  hwmaster version is 1.2.6 now.
* other minor fixes.
* 3dfx gamma hacks are disabled by default at compile time (see the Makefile).
* killed compatibility with user directories from HoT-1.4.0 and earlier which
  didn't operate with a data1 subdirectory. they are ancient history now.
* added initial support for standalone free contents (mods) as an extra patch.
* added extra testing code to support midi when using sdl audio  (extra patch).
* utils, qbsp: accept more than one wad file specified in the value of the
  "wad" key. the wad file names must be separated by a semicolon. spaces are
  allowed in the file names. quoted paths aren't allowed.
* utils, qbsp: the absolute paths in wad values are not touched, ie. the paths
  beginning with a '/' on unix or with a drive specifying string like
  "C:\foo\bar.wad" on windows. all other values with no path information or
  relative path information are prefixed with the project path. this fixes the
  issues reported for qbsp usage from within worldcraft.
* added back some unused code for future reference.  removed some truly dead
  code.
* minor documentation tidy-ups.
