Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uhexen2), CVS snapshot / pre-release,
Version 1.4.4-pre2 / Nov. 08, 2008.

Changes since the HoT-1.4.3 release:

* bumped the hexen2 engine version to 1.22, and hexenworld engine version
  to 0.22.
* fixed the broken software renderer binaries from c++ compilers with x86
  assembly enabled (do not use the bool keyword of C++).
* added initial support for standalone free contents (mods). see the file
  docs/StandaloneMods.txt for details.
* stricter checking on the values pulled out of .wav file chunk headers.
* renamed model_t to qmodel_t in order to avoid conflicts on solaris.
* fixed 'array going out-of-bounds' (utils/map.c) and bogus 'maybe used
  uninitialized' warnings (sbar.c) from gcc-4.3.
* fixes to the SVGALib driver. it is functional now.
* fixed bug #2176384: in windowed mode, when you save using the menus, the game
  used to quit the menu without grabbing the mouse properly.
* utils, qbsp: accept more than one wad file specified in the value of the
  "wad" key. the wad file names must be separated by a semicolon. spaces are
  allowed in the file names. quoted paths aren't allowed.
* utils, qbsp: the absolute paths in wad values are not touched, ie. the paths
  beginning with a '/' on unix or with a drive specifying string like
  "C:\foo\bar.wad" on windows. all other values with no path information or
  relative path information are prefixed with the project path. this fixes the
  issues reported for qbsp usage from within worldcraft.
* increased the buffersize for sdl audio. made it to print a little more
  detailed info at startup.
* added an extra test patch to support midi when using sdl audio. the patch is
  an extra patch (in 00_Patches, not actually applied.)
* other minor fixes.
* added back some unused code for future reference.  removed some truly dead
  code.
* minor documentation tidy-ups.
