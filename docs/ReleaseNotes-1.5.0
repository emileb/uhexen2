Changes since HoT-1.4.4-pre11:

* added support for ogg, mp3 and wav external music files to be played
  instead of the original midi files.
* added interface for music streams to the sound layer, dropped SDL_mixer
  dependency. many changes in sound and midi layer.  imported libtimidity
  into the source tree and applied several fixes.
* unix midi: reimplemented through the new music streams interface using
  timidity.
* windows midi: ignore midi hardware volume adjustment capability under
  windows vista/7 which fixes music volume control messing with the main
  volume.
* software renderer (C-only): fixed a segmentation fault with Crusader's
  ice mace.
* handled several map quirks thanks to careful works by Thomas Freundt
  and Keith Rozett.

* bumped the hexen2 engine version to 1.23, and hexenworld engine version
  to 0.23. bumped the gamecode version to 1.20.

  handle map quirks.  ent files are accepted only if they come from the
  same game directory as the map itself.

  from the same game directory as the map itself.
* tested compilation using Visual Studio 2010.
