Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uhexen2), release candidate,
Version 1.5.0-rc6 / July 13, 2011.

Changes since HoT-1.4.4-pre11:

* bumped the hexen2 engine version to 1.23, and hexenworld engine version
  to 0.23. bumped the gamecode version to 1.20.
* added support for ogg, mp3 and wav external music files to be played
  instead of the original midi files.
* added interface for music streams to the sound layer, dropped SDL_mixer
  dependency. many changes in sound and midi layer.  imported libtimidity
  into the source tree and applied several fixes.
* sound: changed internal driver interface to provide a better chance of
  engine startup with sound, especially for linux (unix) users.
* unix midi: reimplemented through the new music streams interface using
  timidity.
* windows midi: ignore midi hardware volume adjustment capability under
  windows vista/7 which fixes music volume control messing with the main
  volume.
* fixed an old obscure game load/save corruption bug.
* fixed an old load bug where items dropped by monsters not being visible
  or getting lost upon saving and loading the game.
* fixed an old load bug where prize artifacts in the Temple of Mars not
  being visible or getting lost upon saving and loading the game or by
  changing the level and reentering.
* fixed an old load bug where killed monsters didn't respawn in nightmare
  difficulty in the mission pack upon saving and loading the game or by
  changing the level and reentering.
* software renderer (C-only): fixed a segmentation fault with Crusader's
  ice mace.
* added new cvar sys_throttle in order to throttle the game loop just a
  little bit and run cooler on new fast systems. the default sys_throttle
  value is 0.02, acceptable values are between 0 and 1. changing it to 0
  disables throttling.
* opengl: fixed overlapping flickering textures, i.e. the infamous brush
  model Z-fighting.

  command not affect lightmaps.
* opengl: fixed an issue in net games where joining players would appear
  untextured (bug #3288081).

  the romeric5 (Temple of Mars) map, which now loads fine.

  racks in the demo2 and the village1 levels would be placed incorrectly
  (bug #3344613).

  away wizard wouldn't reappear even after imp went away (bug #3314808).

  is dead.
* fixed an Eidolon/imp HexenC bug which used to render Eidolon idle.
* fixed a HexenC bug which would prevent a yakman from appearing during
  the 'Trial of Strength' in the 'Temple of Phurbu' (tibet7) level of the
  mission pack, rendering the level not completable (bug #1112533).
* fixed a mission pack HexenC bug where a pentacle monster in the tibet1
  map became invulnerable when it got crushed by a door.

  to trigger if Praevus were killed too quickly.
* handled several map quirks thanks to careful works by Thomas Freundt
  and Keith Rozett.
* fixed trigger_crosslevel problem with spawnflag 8 which used to prevent
  one of the prizes in Temple of Mars to appear.
* removed the ugly hack of reducing teleport push speed to 225 in order
  to overcome the problem of reaching the Cathedral's balcony and the holy
  cross, and added a modified entities file for the Cathedral map instead.
* added support for external entity file loading which makes it easy to
  handle map quirks.  ent files are accepted only if they come from the
  same game directory as the map itself or from a searchpath with a higher
  priority.
* revised lit file loading. lit files are now accepted only if they come
  from the same game directory as the map itself or from a searchpath with
  a higher priority.

  tool for purposes of updating to hexen2 v1.11 data files. updated the
  gtk-launcher's patch facility to use the same backend.
* utils, hcc: fixed broken switch statement compilation when there is an
  implicit break in the last case.
* utils, dcc: fixed a wrong decompilation of an "if" opcode into a "while";
  some source code revision.
