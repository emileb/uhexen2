Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uhexen2), release candidate,
Version 1.5.0-rc3 / June 04, 2011

Changes since HoT-1.4.4-pre11:

* added support for ogg, mp3 and wav external music files to be played
  instead of the original midi files.
* added interface for music streams to the sound layer, dropped SDL_mixer
  dependency. many changes in sound and midi layer.  imported libtimidity
  into the source tree and applied several fixes.
* unix midi: reimplemented through the new music streams interface using
  timidity.
* windows midi: ignore midi hardware volume adjustment capability under
  windows vista/7 which fixes music volume control messing with the main
  volume.
* software renderer (C-only): fixed a segmentation fault with Crusader's
  ice mace.
* added new cvar sys_throttle in order to throttle the game loop just a
  little bit and run cooler on new fast systems. the default sys_throttle
  value is 0.02, acceptable values are between 0 and 1. changing it to 0
  disables throttling.
* opengl: fixed overlapping flickering textures, i.e. the infamous brush
  model Z-fighting.
* opengl: always use GL_LINEAR as lightmap filter. made gl_texturemode
  command not affect lightmaps.
* opengl: fixed an issue in net games where joining players appeared
  untextured on the opengl server application (bug #3288081).
* opengl: updated code to use glGenTextures().
* fixed a hexenworld server timing issue which used to crash servers upon
  running the romeric5 (Temple of Mars) map which now loads fine.
* fixed a HexenC bug which would prevent a yakman from appearing during
  the 'Trial of Strength' in the 'Temple of Phurbu' (tibet7) level of the
  mission pack, rendering the level not completable (bug #1112533).
* fixed a mission pack HexenC bug where a pentacle monster in the tibet1
  map became invulnerable when it got crushed by a door.
* fixed a wheel of ages message to report 360 degrees instead of 30 in the
  egypt2 map. (patch from Sander van Dijk.)
* fixed a HexenC bug which might prevent Eidolon to land. fixed an Eidolon
  bug which might prevent the finale screen to trigger.
* fixed a HexenC bug where werepanthers became "undead" when an assassin
  killed them by her bombs. fix by Thomas Freundt.
* fixed a mission pack HexenC bug which used to prevent the finale screen
  to trigger if Praevus were killed too quickly. thanks Thomas Freundt.
* handled several map quirks thanks to careful works by Thomas Freundt
  and Keith Rozett.
* fixed trigger_crosslevel problem with spawnflag 8 (thanks Keith Rozett.)
* bumped the hexen2 engine version to 1.23, and hexenworld engine version
  to 0.23. bumped the gamecode version to 1.20.
* added support for external entity file loading which makes it easy to
  handle map quirks.  ent files are accepted only if they come from the
  same game directory as the map itself or from a searchpath with a higher
  priority.
* revised lit file loading. lit files are now accepted only if they come
  from the same game directory as the map itself or from a searchpath with
  a higher priority.
* added new h2patch tool, an easy to use xdelta3-based standalone pak patch
  tool for purposes of updating to hexen2 v1.11 data files. updated the
  gtk-launcher's patch facility to use the same backend.
* utils, dcc: fixed a wrong decompilation of an "if" opcode into a "while";
  some source code revisision.
* tested compilation using Visual Studio 2010.
* source directory layout reworked, repository moved from cvs to svn.
