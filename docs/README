1. Installation
---------------


1.1 Getting Started
-------------------

Linux Hexen II requires Hexen II game files updated to version 1.11.
There are two ways to do this:

a. Using the installer (easy way):
   The installer will get the files from your original cdroms and
   apply the appropriate patches for you. It will also install the
   necessary binaries.
   There is a sub-option named "Hot-fixes for Hexen II", which will
   install fixes for some gameplay issues. We recommend that you
   choose it.  For the curious, names of the Hexen2 binaries are:

	hexen2	 -  Software Hexen II
	glhexen2 -  OpenGL Hexen II

   The second option will allow you to install the Mission Pack
   "Portal of Praevus" (should you have it). All you need to do is
   choosing the Praevus support check-box and readying your cdrom.
   There is a sub-option named "Hot-fixes for Portal of Praevus",
   which will install fixes for some gameplay issues. We recommend
   that you choose it.  The names of the binaries are:

	h2mp	-  Software Portal of Praevus
	glh2mp	-  OpenGL Portal of Praevus

   Third option on the installer is HexenWorld Multiplayer support.
   No cdrom is necessary for this option. Names of the binaries are:

	hwcl	-  HexenWorld Client (software)
	glhwcl	-  HexenWorld Client (OpenGL)
	hwsv	-  HexenWorld Server

b. Manual install/update of datafiles (hard way):
   Copy the "data1" directory from the Hexen II CD to your Hexen II
   directory, do a "chmod 644 *" on the contents, then use the file
   "h2-game-updates-1.12a.tgz" (downloadable from the HoT web site)
   to manually patch your data files to version 1.11. (1.12a refers
   to the version of the mission pack, should you have it).
   All files should be lower-cased (if not already) and can be done
   with "mv_lowercase" from the file-rename-utils archive (see Links).
   Here are the md5sums for the v1.11 Hexen2 and v1.12a MP files:

	4ad129364c4af58ff4bfa8914a48fdcf  data1/hexen.rc
	c9675191e75dd25a3b9ed81ee7e05eff  data1/pak0.pak
	c2ac5b0640773eed9ebe1cda2eca2ad0  data1/pak1.pak
	2334c5036d573d6831fc95737142bf73  data1/progs.dat

	d54e74fe9f6a2b38f9f4e43d03d0e0cf  data1/strings.txt
	2d187e6c0a3a22b52cd807ef0ba56fad  portals/default.cfg
	56a9811d4fbab1736d4ffda6ee56a18c  portals/hexen.rc
	5ebdca473f47729144f088c2ee5e22bb  portals/infolist.txt
	77ae298dd0dcd16ab12f4a68067ff2c3  portals/pak3.pak
	d78612ae67a3051108fdaf98b9ccf23c  portals/progs.dat
	df7c95d83638c187e703cf9c3644339a  portals/puzzles.txt
	adf39e079d40f31ebbf0eb3b7ebf76a8  portals/strings.txt

   There ARE newer updates since 1.11/1.12a. Look for them at our
   website and use them for further fixes (as stated above, they'd
   be automatically installed for you, if you use the installer).


1.2 Software Requirements
-------------------------

Linux Hexen2 may have issues with some sound modules. See "1.4 Sound"
for more info. The only unusual software requirements are:

    SDL (1.2.2 +)	    : Simple DirectMedia Layer libraries
    SDL_mixer (1.2.0 +)	    : required for midi support (should be
			      compiled with timidity+ support)
    ALSA libraries (0.9.8 +): Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
			      libraries. 1.0.4+ recommended.
    nasm (0.98 +)	    : x86 assembler (if you are compiling your
			      own binaries.) 0.98.38 recommended.

1.3 Running the Game:
----------------------

The simplest way of running the game is running the game launcher.
To do this: Either choose it from your start menu (should you chose
to do it during the installation),  or type "hexen2" on the command
line. Choose your options and then press "Launch Hexen2".

The old school way of running the game: go into the installation
directory and run the binary directly. The default mode is windowed.
Use "glhexen2 -f" to start the game in full-screen mode. The
following options are accepted:

 [-h | --help]			  Display this help message
 [-v | --version]		  Display the game version
 [-f | --fullscreen]		  Run the game fullscreen
 [-w | --windowed]		  Run the game windowed
 [-s | --nosound]		  Run the game without sound
 [-g | --gllibrary]		  Select 3D rendering library
 [-nomouse]			  No mouse in window mode
 [-width Width [-height Height]]  Select screen size
 [-bpp]				  Depth for GL fullscreen mode
 [-heapsize Bytes]		  Heapsize

Others may work, but aren't really supported.

You may wish to brighten the display with "xgamma". The script I
use is:

    cd /usr/local/games/hexen2
    xgamma -q -gamma 1.3;       # brighten the display
    ./glhexen2 -width 800 -height 600 -f -heapsize 48000
	    			# default heapsize is 32768
    xgamma -q -gamma 1;         # restore old brightness


1.4 Sound 
---------

a. OSS sound code
-----------------
HoT requires your kernel sound modules to be OSS (Open Sound System)
compatible.  If your game bombs out after sound initialization and
you aren't using the Alsa sound drivers, you may want to try them
(doing that may not be very easy, though.)  Once the Alsa sound
modules are installed and configured, you can use (for example,
on Mandrake):

    rmmod emu10k1          ;# remove OSS sound module for SBLive
    /etc/init.d/alsa start ;# start ALSA sound modules

Make SURE oss-emulation is available: lsmod should list snd-pcm-oss.
Check with alsamixer that the volumes are not turned down to zero.

With ALSA + OSS Emulation, hexen2 should work fine. On Mandrake (9.0
and newer), Fedora Core (2 and newer) and SuSE (8.2 and newer), Alsa
is already included: no worries if you're using them.
Users of Fedora Core 1, RedHat 9 and older can see the FreshRPMS site
and the ALSA site for alsa-sound support.

b. SDL sound code
-----------------
There is now an option to build a new sound driver.  To do this, get
the HoT source code, set "SOUND=SDL" in the Makefile, and type "make"
(a recompile is necessary here).
This sound driver does not have the compatibility issues of the OSS
sound code, BUT it is very much beta: varying from working well, to
not at all.

If you can't get sound working, "-nosound" option will disable it.


1.5 Networking / Multiplayer
----------------------------

Hexen II binaries here WILL NOT play over a network with Windows-
hexen2 binaries:  Do not try it, it simply will NOT work!..
However, the mission pack binaries are compatible across platforms.

This has got nothing to do with us: Raven didn't give us the original
Hexen2-1.11 source, and the network code had changes during the 1.11-
1.12 transition. We only have the 1.12 sources.

Deathmatch, TeamPlay, etc:
	- HexenWorld is highly recommended at both sides.
Cooperative games:
	- Linux side  : (gl)hexen2 or (gl)h2mp,
	- Windows side: (gl)h2mp or jshexen2, or (gl)hexen2 (Pa3pyX-
	  1.14 or 1.15), work just fine with each other.

Here is a network-compatibility table:

===============================================================
Binary		Windows		Linux	  Game		Status
==========	===========	========  ==========	=======

(gl)hexen2	<= 1.11		>= 1.12	  Hexen II	FAILS
		>= 1.12 (*)	>= 1.12	  Hexen II	Runs
==========	===========	========  ==========	=======

(gl)h2mp	>= 1.12		>= 1.12	  Hexen II	Runs
					  Miss. Pack	Runs
==========	===========	========  ==========	=======

(*) Recompiles/ports of the source such as the ones from Pa3Pyx
    or newhexen, jshexen2 and such.
===============================================================


1.6 SaveGames and Configuration files
-------------------------------------

Your savegames and configuration files are stored in a directory
named  .hexen2 in your home folder:  ~/.hexen2    (For the demo
version, it's ~/.hexen2demo instead.)

Savegames/configs for Hexen2 are stored directly under ~/.hexen2/
For the Mission Pack, they are stored under ~/.hexen2/portals/

(Until recently we kept the ".aot" name for compatibility with
the old AoT port, but we think that it's now suitable for AoT,
aot and .aot to retire.)


1.7 Playing the Old Mission in Expansion Pack
---------------------------------------------

Either choose the appropriate option in the game launcher, or type
"m_oldmission 1" (without the quotes) in the game's console.
Choose "New Game" from the menu, then choose "Old Mission". You
will go into the original Hexen2 game.


1.8 Thanks
----------

Thanks to ID Software, Raven Games and Activision for a great game
and for supporting open source software.  Also thanks to Ibiblio.org,
Sourceforge.net for hosting and to Dan Olson and Clément Bourdarias
for the initial Linux port (AoT). Mega Thanks to all the unheralded
Doom/Quake/Hexen modders.

2. Notes
--------

2.1 Tweaks
----------

Quake games are very friendly to tweakers. The best performance gain I
have found is by increasing the value "_snd_mixahead". For users with
slow video cards, changing the gl_ variables may speed up your system.
These are just a few of those that can be changed. For more info see
various Quake tweaking sites.

variable       values
--------       ------
_snd_mixahead  0.1 - 0.9 : 0.1 = less latency, 0.9 = better performance
gl_ztrick      0|1       : 3% performance tweak (some cards unsupported)
gl_picmip      0|1|2
gl_playermip   0|1|2
gl_texturemode gl_nearest                : (least quality, best speed)
               gl_nearest_mipmap_nearest :           ^
               gl_linear_mipmap_nearest  :           v
               gl_linear_mipmap_linear   : (best quality, least speed)

gl_otherglows  0 | 1     : enable glow on green and blue mana
snow_active    0 - 255   : 0 = none, 1 = normal (amount designated by
			   the map), and higher acts as a multiplier


2.2 Mods and Crazy Polygons
---------------------------

Some mission-packs/mods for Quake based games can cause existing player
and monster models to be drawn with lines all over the place.
To fix this, delete the directory  ~/.hexen2/glhexen  and/or
~/.hexen2/portals/glhexen .  When you next run the game, it will remake
this directory and everything should be fine.

The biggest mod I've seen for hexen II is the awesome Fortress of Four
Doors (fo4d.zip). Go and get it, now ;)


2.3 Lines on Screen
-------------------

A common problem (esp. with 3dfx cards) is flickering lines across
the screen caused by gl_ztrick.  To fix this, bring down the console
with the '~' key and enter 'gl_ztrick 0'.
With fresh installations of HoT-1.2.3 this option is disabled by
default.


2.4 Hardware Acceleration
-------------------------

Setting up hardware OpenGL acceleration under Linux used to be a
big deal in the past, but most modern distros do this automatically
now.

Nvidia's drivers for all of their modern video cards are not open
source, and because of this many distributions do not include them.
If your Nvidia card is running slowly this is probably the cause,
you should visit Nvidia.com to download the linux installer. In my
experience these drivers are great, but not all versions work 100%
with all cards. If you have a misbehaving Nvidia video card, try a
different (older) driver.

3dfx Voodoo1/Voodoo2 is no longer hardware accelerated under recent
XFree-4.0 releases.  For OpenGL acceleration of 3dfx Voodoo Graphics/
Voodoo Rush/Voodoo 2 boards, you will have to use older versions of
XFree86 (3.3.x), Glide and Mesa compiled against Glide.  Setting up
a Voodoo1/Voodoo2 card under linux can be a bit of work.


2.5 System Stability
--------------------

3D games are probably the most intensive workout you can give your
PC. Problems with them are not always easy to track down.
I recently had some trouble with glquake which I eventually tracked
down to Mandrake's XFree86-4.3 packages - probably due to compiler
pentium optimizations. I switched to XFree86-4.3 (from Redhat-9.0)
and quake now is rock solid.

I've also had crashes in 3D games associated with

  * Hard drives overheating, seizing system.
  * Bios ram settings being too aggressive, crashing game.
  * Cpu overheating with unpredictable results.


2.6 Other
--------

from Dan Olson:

"Raven didn't give us Hexen 2 source, they gave us Portal of Praevus
source. PoP is a few levels short of being an entirely different game..
I think once I nail a few simple physics bugs, we'll have PoP emulating
Hexen 2 quite nicely, but it's been suggested that I'll need a whole
different physics engine."
