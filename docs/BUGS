Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

Known Bugs
---------------------------

- Linux (Unix): Midi music doesn't work in combination with SDL sound
  driver due to conflicting SDL and SDL_mixer calls. To be looked into.

- Linux (Unix): OSS sound code does not work for a few people, either
  partially or completely. If you suffer from that problem, use Alsa
  or SDL sound.

- Software renderer, C-only code, 64 bit: amd64 DEBUG builds (with all
  optimizations turned off) may not draw some objects depending on the
  viewpoint of the player, e.g. the trees are virtually always missing
  at the start of the demo3 map.  32 bit binaries doesn't have such a
  problem. The problem shows up when gcc-4.1.x is used as the compiler
  without any -O flags, gcc-3.4.x is reported to be fine.

- Software renderer, C-only code, Rider Bosses: The death beams doesn't
  fade out as they do in the intel assembly code. The origin of Famine's
  tractor beam isn't translucent as it should be.

- Hexen II dedicated server: The swords on the weapon racks in village1
  and demo2 levels are placed incorrectly. To be looked into.

- Hexen II dedicated server: Some teleportation sounds get lost by being
  marked as 'not audible at all' in S_StartSound(). To be looked into.

- HexenWorld: Spectator mode (chasecam) isn't as it should be, compare
  with the quakeworld code and fix.

- HexenWorld: Running the map romeric5 (Temple of Mars) crashes the
  server. Known problem since Raven's latest beta versions. (how do I
  fix that???)

- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.

- 3dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2:  Palettized textures are broken with
  the old Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.x drivers work fine. Windows
  people should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.

- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx problem. For best results,
  use Mesa-6.2 on Linux and the latest "MesaFX" driver on Windows.

- Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)
