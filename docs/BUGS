Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

Known Bugs
---------------------------

- Software renderer clients cannot be compiled for non-x86 cpus because
  of some x86 assembly code about translucency which do not have their C
  counterparts yet. For details, see COMPILE and NonIntel.log in docs.

- HexenWorld (OpenGL Client): Dynamic lights have a problem with RGBA
  lightmaps (such as torches doesn't illuminate). Luminance mode is fine.

- Linux (Unix): Midi music doesn't work with SDL sound driver due to
  conflicting SDL and SDL_mixer calls. Will be looked into.

- Linux (Unix): OSS sound code does not work for a few people, either
  partially or completely. If you suffer from that problem, use Alsa
  or SDL sound.

- 3dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2:  Palettized textures are broken with
  the old Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.x drivers work fine. Windows
  people should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.

- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx problem. For best results,
  use Mesa-6.2 on Linux and the latest "MesaFX" driver on Windows.

- Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)

- Hexen II dedicated server: The decorative swords in the village1 and
  demo2 levels are located out of place. To be looked into.

- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.
