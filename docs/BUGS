Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uHexen2)

Known Bugs:
-------------------------------------

- HexenWorld: Spectator mode (the chasecam) isn't as it should be.
- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.

- DOS: HexenWorld client running on DOS can't connect to servers due to
  fragmented packets handling bugs in the WatTCP library. Other clients
  can't connect to DOS H2 servers either,for reasons yet to be analyzed.

- 3dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2:  Palettized textures are broken with
  the old Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.x drivers work fine. Windows
  people should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.
- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx problem. For best results,
  use Mesa-6.2 on Linux and the latest "MesaFX" driver on Windows.
