Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

Known Bugs
---------------------------

- Linux (Unix): Midi music doesn't work in combination with SDL sound
  driver due to conflicting SDL and SDL_mixer calls. To be looked into.

- Linux (Unix): OSS sound code does not work for a few people, either
  partially or completely. If you suffer from that problem, use Alsa
  or SDL sound.

- Software renderer, 64 bit: amd64 DEBUG builds (with all optimizations
  turned off) may not draw some objects depending on the viewpoint of
  the player (reported by Davide Cendron). The C-only code doesn't have
  such a problem when built as 32 bit.

- 64 bit, multiplayer: 32 bit Hexen II clients cannot connect to 64 bit
  Hexen II servers (reported by Davide Cendron). HexenWorld doesn't have
  such a problem.  To be looked into.

- Hexen II dedicated server: The swords on the weapon racks in village1
  and demo2 levels are placed incorrectly. To be looked into.

- Hexen II dedicated server: Some teleportation sounds get lost by being
  marked as 'not audible at all' in S_StartSound(). To be looked into.

- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.

- 3dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2:  Palettized textures are broken with
  the old Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.x drivers work fine. Windows
  people should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.

- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx problem. For best results,
  use Mesa-6.2 on Linux and the latest "MesaFX" driver on Windows.

- Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)
