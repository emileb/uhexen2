Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

Known Bugs
---------------------------

- BUG # 2176023: Can't move backwards after dying:
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2176023&group_id=124987&atid=701006
  Die, auto-reload and can't move backwards; probably can't use some
  artifacts such as the tome of power or the torch, either. The problem
  seems to have stuck in the savegame. This is reported for the mission
  pack; validity for the original Hexen II is unknown; whether this is
  a bug in the engine or a bug in the HCode (progs) is unknown. Raven's
  original bugs.txt file lists an issue of "Tome of Power (use/die/can't
  use)" with a status of "CNR" (can't reproduce) and it seems related to
  this one.  To be analyzed.

- OpenGL:  Running in 16 bit color depth and starting a new game might
  draw gibberish when the loading progress bars should appear. 32 bit is
  fine. Ran into this on Windows with an ATI card. Workaround: go to the
  video options menu and change the color depth to 32 bit before doing
  anything (or, run the game with the "-bpp 32" command line argument.)

- Software renderer, C-only code, Rider Bosses: The death beams doesn't
  fade out as they do in the intel assembly code. The origin of Famine's
  tractor beam isn't translucent as it should be. These models are using
  D_Polyset???T5 functions (EF_SPECIAL_TRANS) and we are doing something
  wrong with their C-implementation.

- BUG # 3344613:  Hexen II dedicated server:  The swords on the weapon
  racks in the demo2 and the village1 levels may be placed incorrectly.
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3344613&group_id=124987&atid=701006
  Their origin_z values are messed up somehow. To be analyzed.

- HexenWorld: Spectator mode (chasecam) isn't as it should be, compare
  with the quakeworld code and fix.

- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.

- 3dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2:  Palettized textures are broken with
  the old Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.x drivers work fine. Windows
  people should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.

- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx problem. For best results,
  use Mesa-6.2 on Linux and the latest "MesaFX" driver on Windows.

- Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)
