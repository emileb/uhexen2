Known Bugs
----------

  Midi music doesn't work with SDL sound driver due to conflicting
  SDL and SDL_mixer calls. There are a few other problems related
  to SDL_mixer/midi. Re-writing midi code for libWildmidi is on the
  TODO list. We may also add alsa (and/or oss) sequencer support.

  OSS sound code does not work for a few people, either partially or
  completely. This includes some sampling rate problems in the first
  place, and probably more things that we are not aware of, yet.
  Although this shouldn't be a problem (we already have ALSA and SDL
  sound drivers), fixing that is on the TODO list.

  3dfx Voodoo1/2: Palettized textures are broken both with Mesa 3.x.
  Mesa-6.x seems to work fine. Voodoo3/5 aren't affected, because DRI
  driver doesn't have those extensions. Nvidia seems to work fine with
  it. Don't know if this is a Mesa bug or Hexen2 bug, yet.

  3dfx Voodoo: Doesn't work correctly with multitexturing, yet.

  Multisampling: When multisampling is enabled (-fsaa N), the "Loading
  widget" isn't displayed correctly, at least on Nvidia.

  Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)

  Coop mode of HexenWorld is broken (known problem since Raven's latest
  beta-0.15)
