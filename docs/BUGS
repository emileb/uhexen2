Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uHexen2)

Known issues:
-------------------------------------

- Unix (SDL) client: Hitting the ESC key to open the menu several times
  or opening and closing the game console several times might result in
  a freeze or an endless loop.
  This is not a uhexen2 bug, it is most likely SDL X11 bug #2325:
  https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2325
  The issue triggers if you have an IME running and XMODIFIERS is set
  to the value proper for that IME.  The bug is already fixed in the
  mainstream SDL repo:  http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/0aade9c0203f
  To solve the problem, either recompile SDL to incorporate the fix,
  or unset XMODIFIERS to work around it.

- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.

- 3dfx Voodoo:  Palettized textures are broken with the old unmodified
  Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.x drivers work fine. Windows people
  should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.
- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx limitation.

- h2ded (hexen2 dedicated server), coop mode issues:
  - Skull wizards may become non-solid and invincible after they blink
    away and come back.
  - Dark Pharaoh's staff would disappear after pushing the switch that
    lowers it.
  - Loading saves may often result in bugs.
  Issues don't seem to happen with "h2 -dedicated".  To be analyzed.
