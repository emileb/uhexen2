Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

Known Bugs
---------------------------

  Linux (Unix): Midi music doesn't work with SDL sound driver due to
  conflicting SDL and SDL_mixer calls. Will be looked into.

  Linux (Unix): OSS sound code does not work for a few people, either
  partially or completely. If you suffer from that problem, use Alsa
  or SDL sound.

  3dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2:  Palettized textures are broken with
  Mesa 3.x. Use Mesa-6.x, which works fine. Windows people should use
  the latest "MesaFX" driver for 3dfx.

  3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing.  In fact,
  this is a 3dfx problem.  For best results, use Mesa-6.2 on linux and
  the latest "MesaFX" driver on windows.

  Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)

  Coop mode of HexenWorld is broken (known problem since Raven's latest
  beta-0.15)
