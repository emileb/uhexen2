Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uHexen2)

Known Bugs:
-------------------------------------

- Unix (SDL) client: Hitting the ESC key to open the menu several times
  or opening and closing the game console several times might result in
  a freeze or an endless loop.
  This is not a uhexen2 bug, it is most likely SDL X11 bug #2325:
  https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2325
  The issue triggers if you have an IME running and XMODIFIERS is set
  to the value proper for that IME.  The bug is already fixed in the
  mainstream SDL repo:  http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/0aade9c0203f
  To solve the problem, either recompile SDL to incorporate the fix,
  or unset XMODIFIERS to work around it.

- HexenWorld: Spectator mode (the chasecam) isn't as it should be.
- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.

- DOS: HexenWorld client running on DOS can't connect to servers due to
  fragmented packets handling bugs in the WatTCP library. Other clients
  can't connect to DOS H2 servers either,for reasons yet to be analyzed.

- 3dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2:  Palettized textures are broken with
  the old Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.x drivers work fine. Windows
  people should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.
- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx problem. For best results,
  use Mesa-6.2 on Linux and the latest "MesaFX" driver on Windows.
