Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

Known Bugs
---------------------------

  Midi music doesn't work with SDL sound driver due to conflicting
  SDL and SDL_mixer calls. There are a few other problems related
  to SDL_mixer/midi. Re-writing midi code for libWildmidi is on the
  TODO list. We may also add alsa (and/or oss) sequencer support.

  OSS sound code does not work for a few people, either partially or
  completely. This includes some sampling rate problems in the first
  place, and probably more things that we are not aware of, yet.
  Although this shouldn't be a problem (we already have ALSA and SDL
  sound drivers), fixing that is on the TODO list.

  3dfx Voodoo1/2:  Palettized textures are broken with Mesa 3.x.
  Mesa-6.x seems to work fine. Banshee and Voodoo3/4/5 aren't affected
  because the DRI driver doesn't have those extensions. Nvidia seems to
  work fine with it. Don't know if this is a Mesa bug or a Hexen2 bug.

  3dfx Voodoo: Doesn't work correctly with multitexturing, yet.

  Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)

  Coop mode of HexenWorld is broken (known problem since Raven's latest
  beta-0.15)


Compiler problems :
---------------------------

  GCC versions in the 2.95.x/2.96 and 3.x series work fine.

  4.0.x series has a problem when unit-at-a-time mode is active, such
  as with optimizations -O2 and -O3, with the resulting hexen2 binary
  segfaulting when a crusader class player uses his tomed ice mace.
  This bug showed up after the cmd layer synchronization between hexen2
  and hexenworld trees (october 2005). The build system automatically
  disables unit-at-a-time if it detects gcc-4.0.x series compilers, so
  there will be no problems with the default build options. With gcc
  version 4.1.0, this problem doesn't exist. Unit-at-a-time mode can be
  forcefully enabled/disabled by adding a DISABLE_UNIT_AT_A_TIME=yes
  (or no) statement on the make commandline or by exporting it as an
  environment variable.

  Gcc version 2.91.66 (aka. egcs-1.1.2) still seems to work OK, but the
  resulting binaries are not tested much. Even version 2.7.2 is reported
  to compile fine, but it doen't like the -march option.

  No other compiler (such as LCC, MS VC, etc) is tested.
