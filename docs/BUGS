Known Bugs
----------

  Midi music doesn't work with SDL sound driver due to conflicting
  SDL and SDL_mixer calls. There are a few other problems related
  to SDL_mixer/midi. Re-writing midi code for libWildmidi is on the
  TODO list.

  OSS sound code does not work for some people, either partially or
  completely. This includes some sampling rate problems, and probably
  more things that we're not aware of, yet. Although this shouldn't
  be a problem anymore (we already have ALSA and SDL sound drivers),
  fixing that is on the TODO list.

  3dfx Voodoo1/Voodoo2: Palettized textures are broken both with
  Mesa 3.x. Mesa-6.x seems to work fine.  Voodoo3/5 aren't affected,
  because DRI driver doesn't have those extensions. Nvidia seems to
  work fine with it, though). Don't know if this is a Mesa bug or
  Hexen2 bug, yet.

  matrox G200: GL games don't display menus correctly (matrox GL bug?)

  Coop mode of HexenWorld is broken (known problem since Raven's latest
  beta-0.15)
