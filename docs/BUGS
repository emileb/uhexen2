Known Bugs
----------

  Midi music doesn't work with SDL sound driver due to conflicting
  SDL and SDL_mixer calls. There are a few other problems related
  to SDL_mixer/midi. Re-writing midi code for libWildmidi is on the
  TODO list. We may also add alsa (and/or oss) sequencer support.

  OSS sound code does not work for a few people, either partially or
  completely. This includes some sampling rate problems in the first
  place, and probably more things that we are not aware of, yet.
  Although this shouldn't be a problem (we already have ALSA and SDL
  sound drivers), fixing that is on the TODO list.

  3dfx Voodoo1/2:  Palettized textures are broken with Mesa 3.x.
  Mesa-6.x seems to work fine. Banshee and Voodoo3/4/5 aren't affected
  because the DRI driver doesn't have those extensions. Nvidia seems to
  work fine with it. Don't know if this is a Mesa bug or a Hexen2 bug.

  3dfx Voodoo: Doesn't work correctly with multitexturing, yet.

  Multisampling: When multisampling is enabled (-fsaa N), the "Loading
  widget" isn't displayed correctly, at least on Nvidia.

  Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)

  Coop mode of HexenWorld is broken (known problem since Raven's latest
  beta-0.15)

  In cl_tent.c of hexenworld, variable StreamEntities[] seems unused, but
  its absence somehow results in broken code for lightning streams, such
  as TE_SWORD_EXPLOSION, TE_LIGHTNING_HAMMER and TE_LIGHTNINGEXPLODE (all
  are of stream->type = TE_STREAM_LIGHTNING .)  The original value of 10
  streams causes the client crash for TE_LIGHTNINGEXPLODE (lightning ball
  of succubus hitting somewhere) either with gcc4, or with any gcc and
  StreamEntities[] removed.  If I increase the number of other types of
  lightning streams, the same thing happens: the Crusader's hammer and the
  Paladin's sword behave similarly.  Even 8 streams can crash the client
  for TE_LIGHTNINGEXPLODE if compiled with gcc4, such as when there are
  beams on the scene.  On the other hand, if compiled with gcc3 and with
  that StreamEntities[] thing in place, the client seems to survive with
  stream numbers even as much as 20.
