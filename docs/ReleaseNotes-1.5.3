Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uhexen2)
Release Notes for version 1.5.3 (Apr. 09, 2012.)
================================================

Changes since the uhexen2-1.5.2 release:

* OpenGL: Made non-power-of-two textures support configurable by a cvar,
  gl_texture_NPOT, disabled by default:  Fixes serious slowdown on some
  old graphics hardware, such as R300 to R500 class Radeons on Mac OS X,
  which the driver is lying about its capability. Added a menu entry to
  enable/disable the feature (OpenGL features -> NPOT textures.)
