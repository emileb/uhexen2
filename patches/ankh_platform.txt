the platform (elevator) in egypt1 leading to the boss-level exit isn't
user friendly: you have to make a timely jump to go past it.

Thomas sent a solution for it (ankh_platform.zip), however:

-  the issue is not an unsolvable problem,
-  the solution requires both an edited entity and an updated hcode,
-  a save in egypt1 level with this patch in effect won't be compatible
   when the patch is reverted,
-  and it has been there since more than 10 or 12 years.

... so I choose not to apply it but provide as an optional patch.
