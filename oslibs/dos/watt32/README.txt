The Watt-32 library here is a customized version of official v2.2-dev10
available from http://home.broadpark.no/~gvanem/ .
It is compiled against djgpp v2.04 using gcc-3.3.6 and modified to use
Z_Malloc & friends from the hexen2 engine source for memory allocation
on the secondary zone.  See config.h and the rest of the modified files
here to understand the customizations.
