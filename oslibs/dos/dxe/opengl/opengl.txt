Choose a DOS GL driver (gl.dxe) from one of the directories listed below
and put it in the same place as glh2dos.exe:

mesa   ->  This is based on well-known Mesa library, version 6.0.2.

sage   ->  This is based on SAGE library of Daniel Borca.

fxmesa ->  This is based on old Mesa version 3.4.2.  Doesn't support new
           features of latest Voodoo4/5 series cards. But for me, it was
           the only version that run smoothly with my Voodoo5 5500 card.

Also do remember to pick the correct glide driver (glide3x.dxe) for your
3dfx card from the voodoo directory.
