libmodplug - v0.8.8.5 release + git (2014-11-27) using sezero's fork
at https://github.com/sezero/libmodplug/

midi formats (*.abc, *.mid) and GUS patches (*.pat) loading disabled.
wav format loading disabled.

only the C-interface is exported in the dlls and the import libraries,
which is what we use. the dll is compiled using mingw (gcc-3.4.5/x86)
or mingw-w64 (gcc-4.5.4/x64), and it is statically linked to libstdc++
and libgcc, therefore no C++ dll dependencies.
