libmodplug - v0.8.8.5 release + git (2014-06-10.)

only the C-interface is exported in the dlls and the import libraries,
which is what we use. the dll is compiled using mingw (gcc-3.4.5/x86)
or mingw-w64 (gcc-4.5.4/x64), and it is statically linked to libstdc++
and libgcc, therefore no C++ dll dependencies.
