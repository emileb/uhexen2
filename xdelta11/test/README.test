The code in this directory produces a test for Xdelta.  To run it you
have to edit the hard-coded constants at the top of the file, which
include "cmd_data_source", which should be the name of a big file
containing source data that the test uses to construct sample inputs.

Of course, a better test would let you run it without any
configuration, but this is not that test.
