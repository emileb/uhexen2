	* configure.in: require glib 1.1.5

	* xdmain.c: added --pristine option, to process gzipped files
	without decompressing them first. It has a flaw in that patch
	must be run with the -p option as well, for now.
	Also removed strip_leading_path in favor of g_basename and
	use g_get_tmp_dir to set tmpdir.

	* Finish implementing the patch app.

	* Pull the serialization stuff from repo to split Xdelta out,
	write the new delta app.

Mon Sep 21 04:23:25 1998  Josh MacDonald  <jmacd@axis.hip.berkeley.edu>

	* xdelta.c (xdp_rsync_reqest): Implement the second phase of
 	rsync.

Sat Sep 19 15:57:48 1998  Josh MacDonald  <jmacd@axis.hip.berkeley.edu>

	* xdelta.c (xdp_control_free): Rename this -- the unused function.
	(generate_checksums): A short-by-one was actually causing the
	terrible matches at the end of a file -- no checksums were being
	computed on the last page.  Aha!
	(xdp_generate_delta_int): Add code for different
	CLOBBER_ALGORITHMS -- haven't evaluated it yet and it is not
	enabled.
