Game code for Hexen2 / H2MP / HexenWorld

Changes
-------

2006-08-11 (1.16) :
===================
- Fixed the dreaded mezzoman bug causing the following error:
	SV_StartSound: fangel/deflect.wav not precached
	ADDRESS -14227(?) 537(last_attack).last_attack -14226(?)
	mezzoman.hc : mezzo_reflect_trig_touch
	<NO FUNCTION>
	assignment to world entity
	Host_Error: Program error
- Disabled impulse 11 (ServerflagsCommand): it is a dev command, can
  be issued from any client and may screw up the server pretty bad..
2006-03-20 (1.15) :
===================
- hw: fixed the server crash when the server is spawned with dmmode 1.
  solution found in the ghost mod.
- hw: properly notify users when dmmode is changed. also remove the
  brightfield from the icon holder when dmmode 1 is abandoned. code
  found in the the ghost mode.
- hw / siege: broadcast the names of the current map and the
  next map in cycle to all clients
- noexit is supposed to matter only for deathmatch, not for coop
  and singleplayer
- CheckRules (timelimit and fraglimit) is supposed to matter only
  for deathmatch, not for coop and singleplayer
- fixed those double semicolons.
- hw: killed the irritating Poisong_die dprint
- fixed those famous spelling errors.
2005-08-09 (1.14) :
===================
- Disallowed cycling to a weapon without proper mana (S.A)
- Enabled impulse 34, (puzzle piece inventory list)  (S.A)
2005-07-29        :
===================
- Map cycling: renamed map_name to a more intuitive map_next
  Cleaned up some dprint's
2005-06-25        :
===================
- Bumped the teleport-push speed to a highest safe value of 225
  (250 is still safe, but just in case)  and restricted that to
  the Cathedral map when not in deathmatch.  Otherwise, Raven's
  original value (300) is used.
2005-05-08	  :
===================
- added Pa3PyX' fire delay bits for paladin's setstaff

2005-03-17 (1.12h):
===================
Merged the actual H2MP 1.12-1.12a patch and it has been missing
here in the CVS for ages. That no one told me about it is a bit
embarassing....

2005-02-23 (1.12g):
===================
Merged a bunch of fixes/adjustments from Pa3PyX' sources:
- fixed ravenstaff bug where splitting missiles would collide
  with each other
- setstaff tomed and untomed fire rates now fps independent
- crossbow fire rate fps now independent (also makes fire rate
  slightly faster, but I liked it ;)
- no more 20 tornadoes per second from meteor staff at 200 fps
- framerate independent Flame Orb fire procedure
- fix demoness abilities according to the manual
- assasin backstab starts at level 6
- crusader holy strength starts at level 6
- necromancer sickle steal adjustments to make it really useful
- assasin cloak ability re-write
- start crusader full-mana ability at level3

2005-02-15 (1.12f):
===================
- added a separate patch file which allows compiling boss maps into
  hwprogs.dat. this is not of much use, because coop seems broken..
- updated the hexenworld boss files according to H2MP. although coop
  is broken as of now, maybe someone messes with these one day...
- added stubs for the hexenworld missing boss-map functions. hwsv no
  longer crashes on maps rider1a, rider2c, romeric6, meso9 and eidolon.

2005-01-27:
===========
- Applied Kor Skarn's further changes to the Siege hcode:  This is the
  code to the hwprogs.dat in "sgcycle.zip". Seems to be first intended
  for Rival Kingdoms?...
2005-01-26:
===========
- Applied map cycling patch for Siege (similar to the one below)
- Added the hcode for Siege.
- Applied map cycling for HexenWorld (by Kor Skarn):  Server side mod,
so only the server needs to have the new hwprogs.dat and strings.txt.
The new strings.txt can then be edited for the required mapnames.
* map names must stay between map_sequence_start and map_sequence_end
* only the first occurence of a mapname is used to determine next map
* if server is running a map that is not in the list the same map will
  reload when game ends.
* when server reaches the end of the list, the last map reloads when
  game ends it does NOT make a loop. To make a loop, add the name of
  the first map after the last one (it looks for a mapname matching
  current one and takes the following name for next map)
* any number of maps can be put in it
* remove the map entries AND "map_sequence_start / map_sequence_end"
  strings (or use old strings.txt): server works as without the mod.
