Game code for Hexen2 / H2MP / HexenWorld

Changes
-------

2005-02-15 (1.12f):
===================
- added a separate patch file which allows compiling boss maps into
  hwprogs.dat. this is not of much use, because coop seems broken..
- updated the hexenworld boss files according to H2MP. although coop
  is broken as of now, maybe someone messes with these one day...
- added stubs for the hexenworld missing boss-map functions. hwsv no
  longer crashes on maps rider1a, rider2c, romeric6, meso9 and eidolon.

2005-01-27:
===========
- Applied Kor Skarn's further changes to the Siege hcode:  This is the
  code to the hwprogs.dat in "sgcycle.zip". Seems to be first intended
  for Rival Kingdoms?...
2005-01-26:
===========
- Applied map cycling patch for Siege (similar to the one below)
- Added the hcode for Siege.
- Applied map cycling for HexenWorld (by Kor Skarn):  Server side mod,
so only the server needs to have the new hwprogs.dat and strings.txt.
The new strings.txt can then be edited for the required mapnames.
* map names must stay between map_sequence_start and map_sequence_end
* only the first occurence of a mapname is used to determine next map
* if server is running a map that is not in the list the same map will
  reload when game ends.
* when server reaches the end of the list, the last map reloads when
  game ends it does NOT make a loop. To make a loop, add the name of
  the first map after the last one (it looks for a mapname matching
  current one and takes the following name for next map)
* any number of maps can be put in it
* remove the map entries AND "map_sequence_start / map_sequence_end"
  strings (or use old strings.txt): server works as without the mod.
