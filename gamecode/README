Game code for Hexen2 / H2MP / HexenWorld

Changes
-------

2011-05-17 (1.20):
===================
- Bumped version number to 1.20.
- Worked around HexenC issue which used to crash HexenWorld servers upon
  running the romeric5 (Temple of Mars) map.
- Fixed a HexenC bug which would prevent a yakman from appearing during
  the 'Trial of Strength' in the Temple of Phurbu (tibet7) level of the
  mission pack, rendering the level not completable (bug #1112533).
- Fixed a mission pack HexenC bug where a pentacle monster in tibet1
  became invulnerable when it got crushed by a door.
- strings.txt: Fixed egypt2 wheel of ages message to report 360 degrees
  instead of 30 when it "points to a jackal". Patch from Sander van Dijk.
- Fixed a bug where werepanthers became "undead" when an assassin killed
  them by her bombs. Fix by Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed a bug which might prevent Eidolon to land. Fixed more Eidolon
  bugs which might prevent the finale screen to trigger. Analyzed and
  fixed by Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed a bug which used to prevent the finale screen to trigger if
  Praevus were killed too quickly in buddha_die() and buddha_run().
  Analyzed and fixed by Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed trigger_crosslevel() with spawnflag 8, i.e. the clash with
  SPAWNFLAG_ACTIVATED. We now just set inactive property back to FALSE
  after calling InitTrigger(). Thanks to Keith Rozett.
- Added more entity fixes, this time for tibet2 and tibet9 maps of the
  expansion pack and for demo2, egypt4 and tower maps of the original
  game.
2010-11-27 (1.19b):
===================
- Added a "mapfixes" section. Added entity fixes for romeric5.bsp and
  egypt5.bsp among the mapfixes.
2008-01-01 (1.19a):
===================
- Updated the patch shell scripts for much better compatibility with BSD
  and other systems. No other source code or binary data change.
2006-03-18 (1.19):
===================
- Origin fixes for tomed fires of vorpal sword and purifier: paladin used
  to fire them always from the non-crouched eye position, and it was even
  the worst when he was looking up (and down). You won't be shooting your
  back when standing just in front of a wall and fire your tomed purifier
  to the sky, from now on ;)
2006-12-01 (1.16a):
===================
- Fixed an obscure bug where the assasin with her 4th weapon uses the tome
  of power and can't fire it. The bug was reported by Mathias Schlueter to
  Jacques 'Korax' Krige who forwarded the report to us.  (The bug seems to
  have been introduced in gamecode-1.12g when a patch from Pa3PyX's sources
  was merged. Pa3PyX's own progs as part of his 1.15 package also has the
  same bug.)
2006-10-30 (1.16) :
===================
- Fixed the dreaded mezzoman bug causing the following error:
	SV_StartSound: fangel/deflect.wav not precached
	ADDRESS -14227(?) 537(last_attack).last_attack -14226(?)
	mezzoman.hc : mezzo_reflect_trig_touch
	<NO FUNCTION>
	assignment to world entity
	Host_Error: Program error
- Merged a probably better fix for the above bug. (from Steven).
- Disabled impulse 11 (ServerflagsCommand): it is a dev command, can
  be issued from any client and may screw up the server pretty bad..
- Made the hexen2 progs to work with demo version 1.11: the original
  demo version excluded the necromancer and crusader classes, but the
  later one didn't care and included them. changing some precache_model3
  and precache_sound3 to precache_model and precache_sound solves it.
  the pak file of 1.11 demo version already contains the necessary stuff.
- Made the hexenworld progs to work with demo version 1.11: Raven
  actually did all of the changes, but they seem to have missed
  changing the precache_model2 calls to precache_model in wp_art.hc
  which prevented crusader and necromancer classes to be played with.
- Ported the demo-1.11 precache compatibility changes from hexen2 to
  the mission pack. the mission pack actually has nothing to do with
  the demo version, but this is for the sake of the two trees being
  in sync as much as possible.
- Ported the demo-1.11 precache compatibility changes from hexenworld to
  siege. siege actually doesn't have much to do with the demo, but this
  is for the sake of the two trees being in sync as much as possible.
- Cleaned up and tweaked hexenworld and siege map cycling.
- Fixed hexen2 and hexenworld server crashes upon deathmatch level change
  in cases of a custom map being run and there is no map cycling. mission
  pack actually didn't used to crash but it always failed changing into
  a new level. it is now fixed, as well.
- Since version 1.11 of hexen2 demo already contains the demo3 level and
  it also has necessary stuff for running the hexenworld dm maps, added
  demo3 and the hw dm maps to FindDMLevel(). Similarly changed the hexen2
  and the mission pack versions.
2006-03-20 (1.15) :
===================
- hw: fixed the server crash when the server is spawned with dmmode 1.
  solution found in the ghost mod.
- hw: properly notify users when dmmode is changed. also remove the
  brightfield from the icon holder when dmmode 1 is abandoned. code
  found in the the ghost mode.
- hw / siege: broadcast the names of the current map and the
  next map in cycle to all clients
- noexit is supposed to matter only for deathmatch, not for coop
  and singleplayer
- CheckRules (timelimit and fraglimit) is supposed to matter only
  for deathmatch, not for coop and singleplayer
- fixed those double semicolons.
- hw: killed the irritating Poisong_die dprint
- fixed those famous spelling errors.
2005-08-09 (1.14) :
===================
- Disallowed cycling to a weapon without proper mana (S.A)
- Enabled impulse 34, (puzzle piece inventory list)  (S.A)
2005-07-29        :
===================
- Map cycling: renamed map_name to a more intuitive map_next
  Cleaned up some dprint's
2005-06-25        :
===================
- Bumped the teleport-push speed to a highest safe value of 225
  (250 is still safe, but just in case)  and restricted that to
  the Cathedral map when not in deathmatch.  Otherwise, Raven's
  original value (300) is used.
2005-05-08	  :
===================
- added Pa3PyX' fire delay bits for paladin's setstaff

2005-03-17 (1.12h):
===================
Merged the actual H2MP 1.12-1.12a patch and it has been missing
here in the CVS for ages. That no one told me about it is a bit
embarassing....

2005-02-23 (1.12g):
===================
Merged a bunch of fixes/adjustments from Pa3PyX' sources:
- fixed ravenstaff bug where splitting missiles would collide
  with each other
- setstaff tomed and untomed fire rates now fps independent
- crossbow fire rate fps now independent (also makes fire rate
  slightly faster, but I liked it ;)
- no more 20 tornadoes per second from meteor staff at 200 fps
- framerate independent Flame Orb fire procedure
- fix demoness abilities according to the manual
- assasin backstab starts at level 6
- crusader holy strength starts at level 6
- necromancer sickle steal adjustments to make it really useful
- assasin cloak ability re-write
- start crusader full-mana ability at level3

2005-02-15 (1.12f):
===================
- added a separate patch file which allows compiling boss maps into
  hwprogs.dat. this is not of much use, because coop seems broken..
- updated the hexenworld boss files according to H2MP. although coop
  is broken as of now, maybe someone messes with these one day...
- added stubs for the hexenworld missing boss-map functions. hwsv no
  longer crashes on maps rider1a, rider2c, romeric6, meso9 and eidolon.

2005-01-27:
===========
- Applied Kor Skarn's further changes to the Siege hcode:  This is the
  code to the hwprogs.dat in "sgcycle.zip". Seems to be first intended
  for Rival Kingdoms?...
2005-01-26:
===========
- Applied map cycling patch for Siege (similar to the one below)
- Added the hcode for Siege.
- Applied map cycling for HexenWorld (by Kor Skarn):  Server side mod,
so only the server needs to have the new hwprogs.dat and strings.txt.
The new strings.txt can then be edited for the required mapnames.
* map names must stay between map_sequence_start and map_sequence_end
* only the first occurence of a mapname is used to determine next map
* if server is running a map that is not in the list the same map will
  reload when game ends.
* when server reaches the end of the list, the last map reloads when
  game ends it does NOT make a loop. To make a loop, add the name of
  the first map after the last one (it looks for a mapname matching
  current one and takes the following name for next map)
* any number of maps can be put in it
* remove the map entries AND "map_sequence_start / map_sequence_end"
  strings (or use old strings.txt): server works as without the mod.

	forward. Fixes the unreachable Cathedral balcony issue for
	me (for both Hexen2 and H2MP) (2005-01-06).
