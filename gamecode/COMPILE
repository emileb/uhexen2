In order to compile the hcode (the *.hc files)
into hexen2-usable progs.dat files, you need
the hcc program (the hcode compiler). You can
find the sources for this utility either in
hexen2source-1.4.1, or in the uhexen2 cvs, or
as a separate package named "hexen2utils.tgz"
on Hammer of Thyrion downloads page.

In order to compile the original hexen2 hcode,
use the old version of the hcc program (found
in "hcc_old" in the utils.) The newer version
would still work, but try not to use its -oi
and -on command line switches. Do:

# hcc -name progs.src
# hcc -name progs2.src

In order to compile the missionpack, hexenworld
or siege hcode, use the new version of the hcc
program. Do:

# hcc -oi -on -name progs.src
