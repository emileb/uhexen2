This directory contains binary patches to update 1.03 cdrom
versions hexen2 pak files to the latest 1.11 version. This
update is the same as Raven's 1.11 update, but it is for unix.
You need either loki_patch or xdelta1.13 in order to use them.

The update_xdelta.sh script uses an updated version of xdelta

(The original version of xdelta-1.1.3 can be found at its home
page at sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdelta )

The update_loki.sh script and the associated .dat file are to be
used with a loki_patch version posted on Hammer of Thyrion page:
loki_patch-src3.tgz. (The original version of loki_patch is in
icculus.org CVS : http://cvs.icculus.org/cvs/ )
