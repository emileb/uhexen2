This directory contains binary patches to update the 1.03 cdrom
versions of hexen2 pak files to the latest 1.11 version. This
update is the same as Raven's 1.11 update, but it is for unix.
You need either 1.0.1 or a later version of our launcher program,
or xdelta-1.1.3/1.1.4, or loki_patch, in order to use them.

The update_xdelta.sh script uses an updated version of xdelta
which is included in the latest Hammer of Thyrion sources with
xdelta11 as its module name.
(The original version of xdelta can be found at its project
page at sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdelta
or at http://xdelta.org .)

The update_loki.sh script and the associated .dat file are to be
used with a loki_patch version posted on Hammer of Thyrion page:
loki_patch-src4.tgz. (The original version of loki_patch is in
icculus.org CVS : http://cvs.icculus.org/cvs/ )
