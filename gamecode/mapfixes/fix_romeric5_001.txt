Map: romeric5.bsp (Hexen II registered version, in the data1/pak1.pak
pakfile.)

One of the prizes (the chaos device in the southeast corner) never shows
because the trigger_crosslevel_target that is supposed to spawn it is
missing a spawnflag (128).  In short, the ent that reads in the original
like:

{
"target" "t14"
"classname" "trigger_crosslevel_target"
"model" "*13"
}

... should look like:

{
"target" "t14"
"spawnflags" "128"
"classname" "trigger_crosslevel_target"
"model" "*13"
}

(See around line 643 of the romeric5.ent file included here. Identified
and fixed by Keith Rozett.)

- go into the hexen2 installation directory
- copy qbsp into there (from hexen2 utils)
- copy pakx into there (from hexen2 utils)
- place romeric5.ent there so that you have it like data1/maps/romeric5.ent
- run:
  ./pakx -outdir data1 data1/pak1.pak maps/romeric5.bsp
  ./qbsp -onlyents data1/maps/romeric5.ent
