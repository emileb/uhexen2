Map: egypt5.bsp (Hexen II registered version, in the data1/pak1.pak
pakfile.)

Dark Pharaoh's Scepter used to appear a little stuck in the
wall.  Fixed by changing its origin from "-2104 304 112" to
"-2096 304 112", ie. the entity that reads in the original
like:

{
"spawnflags" "32768"
"origin" "-2104 304 112"
"classname" "puzzle_piece"
"netname" "Dark Pharaoh's Scepter"
"puzzle_id" "scept"
}

... should look like:

{
"spawnflags" "32768"
"origin" "-2096 304 112"
"classname" "puzzle_piece"
"netname" "Dark Pharaoh's Scepter"
"puzzle_id" "scept"
}

(See around line 1567 of the egypt5.ent file included here.  Fix
by Thomas Freundt.)

- go into the hexen2 installation directory
- place egypt5.ent there so that you have it like data1/maps/egypt5.ent
- as of Hammer of Thyrion 1.5.0 (at least rc1 from 2010-12-29), the engine
  will automatically load this ent file. If using an older version, then do
  the following:
- copy qbsp into there (from hexen2 utils)
- copy pakx into there (from hexen2 utils)
- run:
  ./pakx -outdir data1 data1/pak1.pak maps/egypt5.bsp
  ./qbsp -onlyents data1/maps/egypt5.ent
