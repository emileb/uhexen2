Map: tibet9.bsp (Hexen II Mission Pack: Portal of Praevus, in portals/pak3.pak
pakfile.)

In map tibet9 (Palace Inner Chambers) with easy/medium difficulty, objective
#49 "To pass the Guardians in the Inner Chambers, ..." was never cleared.
Fixed by adding a new trigger_objective with spawnflags 0xC002 and targetname
t29, like in the following:

{
"classname" "trigger_objective"
"spawnflags" "49154"
"frags" "49"
"targetname" "t29"
}

(See around line 580 of the tibet9.ent file included here. Analyzed and fixed
by Thomas Freundt.)

- go into the hexen2 installation directory
- place tibet9.ent there so that you have it like portals/maps/tibet9.ent
- as of Hammer of Thyrion 1.5.0 (at least rc1 from 2010-12-29), the engine
  will automatically load this ent file. If using an older version, then do
  the following:
- copy qbsp into there (from hexen2 utils)
- copy pakx into there (from hexen2 utils)
- run:
  ./pakx -outdir portals portals/pak3.pak maps/tibet9.bsp
  ./qbsp -onlyents portals/maps/tibet9.ent
