libTiMidity -- MIDI to WAVE converter library.

This library is based on the TiMidity decoder from SDL_sound library.
Purpose to create this library is to avoid unnecessary dependences.
SDL_sound requires SDL and some other libraries, that not needed to
process MIDI files. In addition libTiMidity provides more suitable
API to work with MIDI songs, it enables to specify full path to the
timidity configuration file, and have function to retrieve meta data
from MIDI song.

If you have propositions regarding development of this library please

This is a fork of the original libTiMidity project:
