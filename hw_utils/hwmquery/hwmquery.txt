HWMQUERY v0.1

Usage:  hwmquery <address>[:port]

This tiny console application queries a hexenworld master server and
lists the servers that it has registered without processing. It uses
26900 as the default master server port. It is aimed mainly for linux
(unix) users, but also works on windows.

I put together this simple program because, as of this writing, qstat
(therefore xqf, too) can't query a hexenworld master server.
